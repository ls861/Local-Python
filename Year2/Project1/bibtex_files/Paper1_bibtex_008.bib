	abstract = {We compare the star-forming main sequence (SFMS) of galaxies - both integrated and resolved on 1 kpc scales - between the high-resolution TNG50 simulation of IllustrisTNG and observations from the 3D-HST slitless spectroscopic survey at z {\textasciitilde} 1. Contrasting integrated star formation rates (SFRs), we find that the slope and normalization of the star-forming main sequence in TNG50 are quantitatively consistent with values derived by fitting observations from 3D-HST with the Prospector Bayesian inference framework. The previous offsets of 0.2-1 dex between observed and simulated main-sequence normalizations are resolved when using the updated masses and SFRs from Prospector. The scatter is generically smaller in TNG50 than in 3D-HST for more massive galaxies with M*{\textgreater} 1010 M⊙, by {\textasciitilde}10-40 per cent, after accounting for observational uncertainties. When comparing resolved star formation, we also find good agreement between TNG50 and 3D-HST: average specific star formation rate (sSFR) radial profiles of galaxies at all masses and radii below, on, and above the SFMS are similar in both normalization and shape. Most noteworthy, massive galaxies with M*{\textgreater} 1010.5 M⊙, which have fallen below the SFMS due to ongoing quenching, exhibit a clear central SFR suppression, in both TNG50 and 3D-HST. In contrast, the original Illustris simulation and a variant TNG run without black hole kinetic wind feedback, do not reproduce the central SFR profile suppression seen in data. In TNG, inside-out quenching is due to the supermassive black hole (SMBH) feedback model operating at low accretion rates.},

	abstract = {We use the panchromatic SED-fitting code Prospector to measure the galaxy logM\${\textasciicircum}*\$-logSFR relationship (the `star-forming sequence') across \$0.2 {\textless} z {\textless} 3.0\$ using the COSMOS-2015 and 3D-HST UV-IR photometric catalogs. We demonstrate that the chosen method of identifying star-forming galaxies introduces a systematic uncertainty in the inferred normalization and width of the star-forming sequence, peaking for massive galaxies at \${\textbackslash}sim 0.5\$ dex and \${\textbackslash}sim0.2\$ dex respectively. To avoid this systematic, we instead parameterize the density of the full galaxy population in the logM\${\textasciicircum}*\$-logSFR-redshift plane using a flexible neural network known as a normalizing flow. The resulting star-forming sequence has a low-mass slope near unity and a much flatter slope at higher masses, with a normalization \$0.2-0.5\$ dex lower than typical inferences in the literature. We show this difference is due to the sophistication of the Prospector stellar populations modeling: the nonparametric star formation histories naturally produce higher masses while the combination of individualized metallicity, dust, and star formation history constraints produce lower star formation rates than typical UV+IR formulae. We introduce a simple formalism to understand the difference between SFRs inferred from spectral energy distribution fitting and standard template-based approaches such as UV+IR SFRs. Finally, we demonstrate the inferred star-forming sequence is consistent with predictions from theoretical models of galaxy formation, resolving a long-standing \${\textbackslash}sim0.2-0.5\$ dex offset with observations at \$0.5},

	abstract = {We present catalogues of stellar masses, star formation rates (SFRs), and ancillary stellar population parameters for galaxies spanning 0 {\textless} z {\textless} 9 from the Deep Extragalactic VIsible Legacy Survey (DEVILS). DEVILS is a deep spectroscopic redshift survey with very high completeness, covering several premier deep fields including COSMOS (D10). Our stellar mass and SFR estimates are self-consistently derived using the spectral energy distribution (SED) modelling code PROSPECT, using well-motivated parametrizations for dust attenuation, star formation histories, and metallicity evolution. We show how these improvements, and especially our physically motivated assumptions about metallicity evolution, have an appreciable systematic effect on the inferred stellar masses, at the level of {\textasciitilde}0.2 dex. To illustrate the scientific value of these data, we map the evolving galaxy stellar mass function (SMF) and the SFR-M⋆ relation for 0 {\textless} z {\textless} 4.25. In agreement with past studies, we find that most of the evolution in the SMF is driven by the characteristic density parameter, with little evolution in the characteristic mass and low-mass slopes. Where the SFR-M⋆ relation is indistinguishable from a power law at z {\textgreater} 2.6, we see evidence of a bend in the relation at low redshifts (z {\textless} 0.45). This suggests evolution in both the normalization and shape of the SFR-M⋆ relation since cosmic noon. It is significant that we only clearly see this bend when combining our new DEVILS measurements with consistently derived values for lower redshift galaxies from the Galaxy And Mass Assembly (GAMA) survey: this shows the power of having consistent treatment for galaxies at all redshifts.},

To test this method and compare it with other published methods, we construct mock photometric samples of galaxies at z {\textasciitilde} 5 based on idealized models combined with broad- and medium-band filters at wavelengths 0.8-5 μm. Adopting simple Ψ estimates based on dust-corrected ultraviolet luminosity can underestimate σ. We find that broad-band fluxes alone cannot constrain the contribution from emission lines, implying that strong priors on the emission-line contribution are required if no medium-band constraints are available. Therefore, at high redshifts, where emission lines contribute a higher fraction of the broad-band flux, photometric fitting is sensitive to Ψ variations on short ({\textasciitilde}10 Myr) time-scales. Priors on age imposed with a constant (or rising) star formation history (SFH) do not allow one to investigate a possible dependence of σ on \${\textbackslash}hbox\{\$\{{\textbackslash}rm M\}\$\}\_\{{\textbackslash}star \}\$ at high redshifts. Delayed exponential SFHs have less constrained priors, but do not account for Ψ variations on short time-scales, a problem if σ increases due to stochasticity of star formation. A simple SFH with current star formation decoupled from the previous history is appropriate. We show that, for simple exposure-time calculations assuming point sources, with low levels of dust, we should be able to obtain unbiased estimates of the main sequence down to \${\textbackslash}mathrm\{ log\}({\textbackslash}hbox\{\$\{{\textbackslash}rm M\}\$\}/{\textbackslash}hbox\{\$\{{\textbackslash}rm M\}\_\{{\textbackslash}odot \}\$\}){\textbackslash}sim 8\$ at z {\textasciitilde} 5 with the James Webb Space Telescope while allowing for stochasticity of star formation.},

	abstract = {We present new measurements of the UV spectral slope β for galaxies at z = 6-9 in the Frontier Field cluster MACS J0416.1-2403 and its parallel field to an unprecedented level of low stellar mass. We fit synthetic stellar population models to the observed spectral energy distribution and calculate β by fitting a power law to the best-fit spectrum. With this method, we report the derivation of rest-frame UV colors of galaxies for the Frontier Fields program extending out to z = 9, probing magnitudes as faint as MUV = -13.5 at z = 6. We find no significant correlation between β and rest-frame UV magnitude M1500 all redshifts, but we do find a strong correlation between β and stellar mass, with lower-mass galaxies exhibiting bluer UV slopes. At z = 7, the bluest median value of our sample is redder than the previously reported values in the literature, whereas at z = 9, our bluest data point has a median value of \${\textbackslash}beta =-\{2.63\}\_\{-0.43\}{\textasciicircum}\{+0.52\}\$ . Thus, we find no evidence for extreme stellar populations at z {\textgreater} 6. We also observe a strong correlation between β and star formation rate (SFR), such that galaxies with low SFRs exhibit bluer slopes. Additionally, there exists a star formation main sequence up to z = 9 with SFRs correlating with stellar mass. All of these relations show that β values correlate with a process that drives both the overall SFR and stellar mass assembly. Furthermore, we observe no trend between β and specific SFR, suggesting that β is getting set by a global process driven by the scale of the galaxy.},

We measure the MS using mean stacks of 3 GHz radio-continuum images to derive average SFRs for ∼ 200,000 mass-selected galaxies at z {\textgreater} 0.3 in the COSMOS field. We describe the MS relation by adopting a new model that incorporates a linear relation at low stellar mass (log(M*/M⊙) {\textless} 10) and a flattening at high stellar mass that becomes more prominent at low redshift (z {\textless} 1.5). We find that the SFR density peaks at 1.5 {\textless} z {\textless} 2, and at each epoch there is a characteristic stellar mass (M* = 1-4 × 1010M⊙) that contributes the most to the overall SFR density. This characteristic mass increases with redshift, at least to z ∼ 2.5. We find no significant evidence for variations in the MS relation for galaxies in different environments traced by the galaxy number density at 0.3 {\textless} z {\textless} 3, nor for galaxies in X-ray groups at z ∼ 0.75. We confirm that massive bulge-dominated galaxies have lower SFRs than disk-dominated galaxies at a fixed stellar mass at z {\textless} 1.2. As a consequence, the increase in bulge-dominated galaxies in the local star-forming population leads to a flattening of the MS at high stellar masses. This indicates that "mass quenching" is linked with changes in the morphological composition of galaxies at a fixed stellar mass.},

	abstract = {There is a severe tension between the observed star formation rate (SFR)-stellar mass (M⋆) relations reported by different authors at z = 1-4. In addition, the observations have not been successfully reproduced by state-of-the-art cosmological simulations that tend to predict a factor of 2-4 smaller SFRs at a fixed M⋆. We examine the evolution of the SFR-M⋆ relation of z = 1-4 galaxies using the SKIRT simulated spectral energy distributions of galaxies sampled from the Evolution and Assembly of GaLaxies and their Environments simulations. We derive SFRs and stellar masses by mimicking different observational techniques. We find that the tension between observed and simulated SFR-M⋆ relations is largely alleviated if similar methods are used to infer the galaxy properties. We find that relations relying on infrared wavelengths (e.g. 24 \{ μ m\}, MIPS - 24, 70, and 160 \{ μ m\} or SPIRE - 250, 350, and 500 \{ μ m\}) have SFRs that exceed the intrinsic relation by 0.5 dex. Relations that rely on the spectral energy distribution fitting technique underpredict the SFRs at a fixed stellar mass by -0.5 dex at z ∼ 4 but overpredict the measurements by 0.3 dex at z ∼ 1. Relations relying on dust-corrected rest-frame ultraviolet luminosities, are flatter since they overpredict/underpredict SFRs for low/high star-forming objects and yield deviations from the intrinsic relation from 0.10 to -0.13 dex at z ∼ 4. We suggest that the severe tension between different observational studies can be broadly explained by the fact that different groups employ different techniques to infer their SFRs.},

	abstract = {The star formation histories (SFHs) of galaxies contain imprints of the physical processes responsible for regulating star formation during galaxy growth and quenching. We improve the Dense Basis SFH reconstruction method of Iyer \& Gawiser, introducing a nonparametric description of the SFH based on the lookback times at which a galaxy assembles certain quantiles of its stellar mass. The method uses Gaussian processes to create smooth SFHs independent of any functional form, with a flexible number of parameters that is adjusted to extract the maximum amount of information from the SEDs being fit. Applying the method to reconstruct the SFHs of 48,791 galaxies with H {\textless} 25 at 0.5 {\textless} z {\textless} 3.0 across the five Cosmic Assembly Near-infrared Deep Extragalactic Legacy Survey fields, we study the evolution of galaxies over time. We quantify the fraction of galaxies that show multiple major episodes of star formation, finding that the median time between two peaks of star formation is ∼ \{0.42\}-0.10+0.15\{t\vphantom{\{}\}univ\} \{Gyr\}, where t univ is the age of the universe at a given redshift and remains roughly constant with stellar mass. Correlating SFHs with morphology allows us to compare the timescales on which the SFHs decline for different morphological classifications, ranging from \{0.60\}+1.54-0.54 \{Gyr\} for galaxies with spiral arms to \{2.50\}+2.25-1.50 \{Gyr\} for spheroids at 0.5 {\textless} z {\textless} 1.0 with 1010 {\textless} M * {\textless} 1010.5 M ⊙. The Gaussian process-based SFH description provides a general approach to reconstruct smooth, flexible, nonparametric SFH posteriors for galaxies that can be incorporated into Bayesian SED fitting codes to minimize the bias in estimating physical parameters due to SFH parameterization.},

	abstract = {We select galaxies from the IllustrisTNG hydrodynamical simulations (M\_stars{\textgreater} 10{\textasciicircum}9 M\_⊙ at 0 ≤ z ≤ 2) and characterize the shapes and evolutions of their UVJ and star formation rate-stellar mass (SFR-Mstars) diagrams. We quantify the systematic uncertainties related to different criteria to classify star-forming versus quiescent galaxies, different SFR estimates, and by accounting for the star formation measured within different physical apertures. The TNG model returns the observed features of the UVJ diagram at z ≤ 2, with a clear separation between two classes of galaxies. It also returns a tight star-forming main sequence (MS) for M\_stars{\textless} 10{\textasciicircum}\{10.5\} (M\_⊙) with a ∼0.3 dex scatter at z ∼ 0 in our fiducial choices. If a UVJ-based cut is adopted, the TNG MS exhibits a downwardly bending at stellar masses of about 1010.5-10.7 M⊙. Moreover, the model predicts that \{∼ \}80 (50) per cent of 1010.5-11 M⊙ galaxies at z = 0 (z = 2) are quiescent and the numbers of quenched galaxies at intermediate redshifts and high masses are in better agreement with observational estimates than previous models. However, shorter SFR-averaging time-scales imply higher normalizations and scatter of the MS, while smaller apertures lead to underestimating the galaxy SFRs: overall we estimate the inspected systematic uncertainties to sum up to about 0.2-0.3 dex in the locus of the MS and to about 15 percentage points in the fraction of quenched galaxies. While TNG colour distributions are clearly bimodal, this is not the case for the SFR logarithmic distributions in bins of stellar mass (SFR ≳ 10-3 M⊙yr-1). Finally, the slope and z = 0 normalization of the TNG MS are consistent with observational findings; however, the locus of the TNG MS remains lower by about 0.2-0.5 dex at 0.75 ≤ z {\textless} 2 than the available observational estimates taken at face value.},

	abstract = {Galaxy observations are influenced by many physical parameters: stellar masses, star formation rates (SFRs), star formation histories (SFHs), metallicities, dust, black hole activity, and more. As a result, inferring accurate physical parameters requires high-dimensional models that capture or marginalize over this complexity. Here we reassess inferences of galaxy stellar masses and SFRs using the 14-parameter physical model Prospector- α built in the Prospector Bayesian inference framework. We fit the photometry of 58,461 galaxies from the 3D-HST catalogs at 0.5 {\textless} z {\textless} 2.5. The resulting stellar masses are ∼0.1-0.3 dex larger than the fiducial masses while remaining consistent with dynamical constraints. This change is primarily due to the systematically older SFHs inferred with Prospector. The SFRs are ∼0.1-1+ dex lower than UV+IR SFRs, with the largest offsets caused by emission from “old” (t {\textgreater} 100 Myr) stars. These new inferences lower the observed cosmic SFR density by ∼0.2 dex and increase the observed stellar mass growth by ∼0.1 dex, finally bringing these two quantities into agreement and implying an older, more quiescent universe than found by previous studies at these redshifts. We corroborate these results by showing that the Prospector- α SFHs are both more physically realistic and much better predictors of the evolution of the stellar mass function. Finally, we highlight examples of observational data that can break degeneracies in the current model; these observations can be incorporated into priors in future models to produce new and more accurate physical parameters.},

	abstract = {A tightly correlated star formation rate (SFR)-stellar mass relation of star-forming galaxies, or star-forming sequence (SFS), is a key feature in galaxy property-space that is predicted by modern galaxy formation models. We present a flexible data-driven approach for identifying this SFS over a wide range of SFRs and stellar masses using Gaussian mixture modeling (GMM). Using this method, we present a consistent comparison of the z = 0 SFSs of central galaxies in the Illustris, Evolution and Assembly of GaLaxies and their Environment, and MUFASA hydrodynamic simulations and the Santa Cruz semianalytic model (SC-SAM), alongside data from the Sloan Digital Sky Survey. We find, surprisingly, that the amplitude of the SFS varies by up to ∼0.7 dex (factor of ∼5) among the simulations with power-law slopes ranging from 0.7 to 1.2. In addition to the SFS, our GMM method also identifies subcomponents in the SFR-stellar mass plane corresponding to starburst, transitioning, and quiescent subpopulations. The hydrodynamic simulations are similarly dominated by SFS and quiescent subpopulations unlike the SC-SAM, which predicts substantial fractions of transitioning and starburst galaxies at stellar masses above and below \{10\}10 \{M\}⊙ , respectively. All of the simulations also produce an abundance of low mass quiescent central galaxies in apparent tension with observations. These results illustrate that, even among models that well reproduce many observables of the galaxy population, the z = 0 SFS and other subpopulations still show marked differences that can provide strong constraints on galaxy formation models.},

	abstract = {Star-forming galaxies have been found to follow a relatively tight relation between stellar mass (M{\textless}SUB{\textgreater}*{\textless}/SUB{\textgreater}) and star formation rate (SFR), dubbed the "star formation sequence". A turnover in the sequence has been observed, where galaxies with M{\textless}SUB{\textgreater}*{\textless}/SUB{\textgreater} \&lt; 10{\textless}SUP{\textgreater}10{\textless}/SUP{\textgreater} M{\textless}SUB{\textgreater}⊙{\textless}/SUB{\textgreater} follow a steeper relation than their higher mass counterparts, suggesting that the low-mass slope is (nearly) linear. In this paper, we characterise the properties of the low-mass end of the star formation sequence between 7 ≤ log M{\textless}SUB{\textgreater}*{\textless}/SUB{\textgreater}[M{\textless}SUB{\textgreater}⊙{\textless}/SUB{\textgreater}] ≤ 10.5 at redshift 0.11 \&lt; z \&lt; 0.91. We use the deepest MUSE observations of the Hubble Ultra Deep Field and the Hubble Deep Field South to construct a sample of 179 star-forming galaxies with high signal-to-noise emission lines. Dust-corrected SFRs are determined from Hβ λ4861 and Hα λ6563. We model the star formation sequence with a Gaussian distribution around a hyperplane between logM{\textless}SUB{\textgreater}*{\textless}/SUB{\textgreater}, logSFR, and log(1 + z), to simultaneously constrain the slope, redshift evolution, and intrinsic scatter. We find a sub-linear slope for the low-mass regime where log SFR [M{\textless}SUB{\textgreater}⊙{\textless}/SUB{\textgreater}yr{\textless}SUP{\textgreater}-1{\textless}/SUP{\textgreater}] = 0.83{\textless}SUP{\textgreater}+0.07{\textless}/SUP{\textgreater}{\textless}SUB{\textgreater}-0.06{\textless}/SUB{\textgreater} log M{\textless}SUB{\textgreater}*{\textless}/SUB{\textgreater}[M{\textless}SUB{\textgreater}⊙{\textless}/SUB{\textgreater}]+1.74{\textless}SUP{\textgreater}+0.66{\textless}/SUP{\textgreater}{\textless}SUB{\textgreater}-0.68{\textless}/SUB{\textgreater} log(1 + z), increasing with redshift.

We use star formation histories (SFHs) reconstructed via the Dense Basis method of Iyer \& Gawiser for a sample of 17,873 galaxies at 0.5 {\textless} z {\textless} 6 in the Cosmic Assembly Near-Infrared Deep Extragalactic Legacy Survey GOODS-S field to study the nature and evolution of the SFR-M * correlation. The reconstructed SFHs represent trajectories in SFR-M * space, enabling us to study galaxies at epochs earlier than observed by propagating them backward in time along these trajectories. We study the SFR-M * correlation at z = 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6 using both direct fits to galaxies observed at those epochs and SFR-M * trajectories of galaxies observed at lower redshifts. The SFR-M * correlations obtained using the two approaches are found to be consistent with each other through a K-S test. Validation tests using SFHs from semi-analytic models and cosmological hydrodynamical simulations confirm the sensitivity of the method to changes in the slope, normalization, and shape of the SFR-M * correlation. This technique allows us to further probe the low-mass regime of the correlation at high z by ∼1 dex and over an effective volume of ∼10× larger than possible with just direct fits. We find that the SFR-M * correlation is consistent with being linear down to M * ∼ 106 M ⊙ at z {\textgreater} 4.

	abstract = {Context. Deep far-infrared (FIR) cosmological surveys are known to be affected by source confusion, causing issues when examining the main sequence (MS) of star forming galaxies. In the past this has typically been partially tackled by the use of stacking. However, stacking only provides the average properties of the objects in the stack. {\textless}BR /{\textgreater} Aims: This work aims to trace the MS over 0.2 ≤ z \&lt; 6.0 using the latest de-blended Herschel photometry, which reaches ≈10 times deeper than the 5σ confusion limit in SPIRE. This provides more reliable star formation rates (SFRs), especially for the fainter galaxies, and hence a more reliable MS. {\textless}BR /{\textgreater} Methods: We built a pipeline that uses the spectral energy distribution (SED) modelling and fitting tool CIGALE to generate flux density priors in the Herschel SPIRE bands. These priors were then fed into the de-blending tool XID+ to extract flux densities from the SPIRE maps. In the final step, multi-wavelength data were combined with the extracted SPIRE flux densities to constrain SEDs and provide stellar mass (M{\textless}SUB{\textgreater}⋆{\textless}/SUB{\textgreater}) and SFRs. These M{\textless}SUB{\textgreater}⋆{\textless}/SUB{\textgreater} and SFRs were then used to populate the SFR-M{\textless}SUB{\textgreater}⋆{\textless}/SUB{\textgreater} plane over 0.2 ≤ z \&lt; 6.0. {\textless}BR /{\textgreater} Results: No significant evidence of a high-mass turn-over was found; the best fit is thus a simple two-parameter power law of the form log(SFR) = α[log(M{\textless}SUB{\textgreater}⋆{\textless}/SUB{\textgreater}) - 10.5] + β. The normalisation of the power law increases with redshift, rapidly at z ≲ 1.8, from 0.58 ± 0.09 at z ≈ 0.37 to 1.31 ± 0.08 at z ≈ 1.8. The slope is also found to increase with redshift, perhaps with an excess around 1.8 ≤ z \&lt; 2.9. {\textless}BR /{\textgreater} Conclusions: The increasing slope indicates that galaxies become more self-similar as redshift increases. This implies that the specific SFR of high-mass galaxies increases with redshift, from 0.2 to 6.0, becoming closer to that of low-mass galaxies. The excess in the slope at 1.8 ≤ z \&lt; 2.9, if present, coincides with the peak of the cosmic star formation history. {\textless}P /{\textgreater}Herschel is an ESA space observatory with science instruments provided by European-led Principal Investigator consortia and with important participation from NASA.},

We do this by making new measures of M *, SFR, and stellar age thanks to an improved SED fitting procedure that allows various star formation history for each galaxy. Like others, we find that the slope of the main sequence (MS) of star formation in the (\{M\}* ;\{SFR\}) plane bends at high mass. We observe clear morphological differences among galaxies across the MS, which also correlate with stellar age. At all redshifts, galaxies that are quenching or quenched, and thus old, have high \{\{\{Σ \}\}\}1 (the projected density within the central 1 kpc), while younger, star-forming galaxies span a much broader range of \{\{\{Σ \}\}\}1, which includes the high values observed for quenched galaxies, but also extends to much lower values. As galaxies age and quench, the stellar age and the dispersion of \{\{\{Σ \}\}\}1 for fixed values of M * shows two different regimes: one at the low-mass end, where quenching might be driven by causes external to the galaxies; the other at the high-mass end, where quenching is driven by internal causes, very likely the mass given the low scatter of \{\{\{Σ \}\}\}1 (mass quenching). We suggest that the monotonic increase of central density as galaxies grow is one manifestation of a more general phenomenon of structural transformation that galaxies undergo as they evolve.},

We find a strong dependence of the fraction of obscured star formation (f obscured = SFRIR/SFRUV+IR) on stellar mass, with remarkably little evolution in this fraction with redshift out to z = 2.5. 50\% of star formation is obscured for galaxies with log(M/M ⊙) = 9.4 although unobscured star formation dominates the budget at lower masses, there exists a tail of low-mass, extremely obscured star-forming galaxies at z{\textgreater} 1. For log(M/M ⊙) {\textgreater} 10.5, {\textgreater}90\% of star formation is obscured at all redshifts. We also show that at fixed total SFR, \{f\}\{obscured\} is lower at higher redshift. At fixed mass, high-redshift galaxies are observed to have more compact sizes and much higher star formation rates, gas fractions, and hence surface densities (implying higher dust obscuration), yet we observe no redshift evolution in \{f\}\{obscured\} with stellar mass. This poses a challenge to theoretical models, where the observed compact sizes at high redshift seem in tension with lower dust obscuration.},

Gravitational lensing combined with deep HST observations allows us to extend the analysis of the MS down to \{log\} M/\{M\}⊙ ∼ 7.5 at z≲ 4 and \{log\} M/\{M\}⊙ ∼ 8 at higher redshifts, a factor of ∼10 below most previous results. We perform an accurate simulation to take into account the effect of observational uncertainties and correct for the Eddington bias. This step allows us to reliably measure the MS and in particular its slope. While the normalization increases with redshift, we fit an unevolving and approximately linear slope. We nicely extend to lower masses the results of brighter surveys. Thanks to the large dynamic range in mass and by making use of the simulation, we analyzed any possible mass dependence of the dispersion around the MS. We find tentative evidence that the scatter decreases with increasing mass, suggesting a larger variety of star formation histories in low-mass galaxies. This trend agrees with theoretical predictions and is explained as either a consequence of the smaller number of progenitors of low-mass galaxies in a hierarchical scenario and/or of the efficient but intermittent stellar feedback processes in low-mass halos. Finally, we observe an increase in the SFR per unit stellar mass with redshift milder than predicted by theoretical models, implying a still incomplete understanding of the processes responsible for galaxy growth.},

	abstract = {We present the results of the first, deep Atacama Large Millimeter Array (ALMA) imaging covering the full ≃4.5 arcmin2 of the Hubble Ultra Deep Field (HUDF) imaged with Wide Field Camera 3/IR on HST. Using a 45-pointing mosaic, we have obtained a homogeneous 1.3-mm image reaching σ1.3 ≃ 35 μJy, at a resolution of ≃0.7 arcsec. From an initial list of ≃50 {\textgreater} 3.5σ peaks, a rigorous analysis confirms 16 sources with S1.3 {\textgreater} 120 μJy. All of these have secure galaxy counterparts with robust redshifts ( = 2.15). Due to the unparalleled supporting data, the physical properties of the ALMA sources are well constrained, including their stellar masses (M*) and UV+FIR star formation rates (SFR). Our results show that stellar mass is the best predictor of SFR in the high-redshift Universe; indeed at z ≥ 2 our ALMA sample contains seven of the nine galaxies in the HUDF with M* ≥ 2 × 1010 M⊙, and we detect only one galaxy at z {\textgreater} 3.5, reflecting the rapid drop-off of high-mass galaxies with increasing redshift. The detections, coupled with stacking, allow us to probe the redshift/mass distribution of the 1.3-mm background down to S1.3 ≃ 10 μJy. We find strong evidence for a steep star-forming 'main sequence' at z ≃ 2, with SFR ∝M* and a mean specific SFR ≃ 2.2 Gyr-1. Moreover, we find that ≃85 per cent of total star formation at z ≃ 2 is enshrouded in dust, with ≃65 per cent of all star formation at this epoch occurring in high-mass galaxies (M* {\textgreater} 2 × 1010 M⊙), for which the average obscured:unobscured SF ratio is ≃200. Finally, we revisit the cosmic evolution of SFR density; we find this peaks at z ≃ 2.5, and that the star-forming Universe transits from primarily unobscured to primarily obscured at z ≃ 4.},

	abstract = {The analytic `equilibrium model' for galaxy evolution using a mass balance equation is able to reproduce mean observed galaxy scaling relations between stellar mass, halo mass, star formation rate (SFR), and metallicity across the majority of cosmic time with a small number of parameters related to feedback. Here, we aim to test this data-constrained model to quantify deviations from the mean relation between stellar mass and SFR, I.e. the star-forming galaxy main sequence (MS). We implement fluctuation in halo accretion rates parametrized from merger-based simulations, and quantify the intrinsic scatter introduced into the MS under the assumption that fluctuations in star formation follow baryonic inflow fluctuations. We predict the 1σ MS scatter to be ∼0.2-0.25 dex over the stellar mass range 108-1011 M⊙ and a redshift range 0.5 ≲ z ≲ 3 for SFRs averaged over 100 Myr. The scatter increases modestly at z ≳ 3, as well as by averaging over shorter time-scales. The contribution from merger-induced star formation is generally small, around 5 per cent today and 10-15 per cent during the peak epoch of cosmic star formation. These results are generally consistent with available observations, suggesting that deviations from the MS primarily reflect stochasticity in the inflow rate owing to halo mergers.},

After first demonstrating the ability of our SED-fitting technique to recover EW(Hα) using a sample of galaxies at z ≃ 1.3 with EW(Hα) measurements from 3D-HST grism spectroscopy, we proceed to apply our technique to samples of spectroscopically confirmed and photometric-redshift selected star-forming galaxies at z ≥ 1 in the CANDELS (Cosmic Assembly Near-IR Deep Extragalactic Legacy Survey) UDS and GOODS-S fields. Confining our analysis to a constant stellar mass range (9.5 {\textless} log (M⋆/M⊙) {\textless} 10.5), we find that the median EW(Hα) evolves only modestly with redshift, reaching a rest-frame value of EW(Hα) =301 ± 30 Å by redshift z ≃ 4.5. Furthermore, using estimates of star formation rate (SFR) based on both UV luminosity and Hα line flux, we use our galaxy samples to compare the evolution of EW(Hα) and specific star formation rate (sSFR). Our results indicate that over the redshift range 1 {\textless} z {\textless} 5, the evolution displayed by EW(Hα) and sSFR is consistent, and can be adequately parametrized as ∝ (1 + z)1.0 ± 0.2. As a consequence, over this redshift range, we find that the sSFR and rest-frame EW(Hα) of star-forming galaxies with stellar masses M⋆ ≃ 10{\textasciicircum}\{10\}\{\vphantom{\}} M\_\{sun;\} are related by EW(Hα)/Å = (63 ± 7) × sSFR/Gyr-1. Given the current uncertainties in measuring the SFRs of high-redshift galaxies, we conclude that EW(Hα) provides a useful independent tracer of sSFR for star-forming galaxies out to redshifts of z = 5.},

We find that the main contribution to the scatter observed in the SFR-M{\textless}SUB{\textgreater}∗{\textless}/SUB{\textgreater} plane is the possibility of choosing between different families of SFHs in the SED fitting procedure, while the redshift range plays a minor role.

A total of 106 sources ({\textgreater}5σ) were uncovered at 850 μm from an area of ≃150 arcmin2 in the centre of the COSMOS/UltraVISTA/Cosmic Assembly Near-infrared Deep Extragalactic Legacy Survey (CANDELS) field, imaged to a typical depth of σ850 ≃ 0.25 mJy. We utilize the available multifrequency data to identify galaxy counterparts for 80 of these sources (75 per cent), and to establish the complete redshift distribution for this sample, yielding bar\{z\} = 2.38± 0.09. We have also been able to determine the stellar masses of the majority of the galaxy identifications, enabling us to explore their location on the star formation rate:stellar mass (SFR:M*) plane. Crucially, our new deep 850-μm-selected sample reaches flux densities equivalent to SFR ≃ 100 M⊙ yr-1, enabling us to confirm that sub-mm galaxies form the high-mass end of the `main sequence' (MS) of star-forming galaxies at z {\textgreater} 1.5 (with a mean specific SFR of sSFR = 2.25 ± 0.19 Gyr-1 at z ≃ 2.5). Our results are consistent with no significant flattening of the MS towards high masses at these redshifts. However, our results add to the growing evidence that average sSFR rises only slowly at high redshift, resulting in log10sSFR being an apparently simple linear function of the age of the Universe.},

	abstract = {Using cosmological simulations, we address the properties of high-redshift star-forming galaxies (SFGs) across their main sequence (MS) in the plane of star formation rate (SFR) versus stellar mass. We relate them to the evolution of galaxies through phases of gas compaction, depletion, possible replenishment, and eventual quenching. We find that the high-SFR galaxies in the upper envelope of the MS are compact, with high gas fractions and short depletion times (`blue nuggets'), while the lower SFR galaxies in the lower envelope have lower central gas densities, lower gas fractions, and longer depletion times, consistent with observed gradients across the MS. Stellar-structure gradients are negligible. The SFGs oscillate about the MS ridge on time-scales ∼0.4tHubble (∼1 Gyr at z ∼ 3). The propagation upwards is due to gas compaction, triggered, e.g. by mergers, counter-rotating streams, and/or violent disc instabilities. The downturn at the upper envelope is due to central gas depletion by peak star formation and outflows while inflow from the shrunken gas disc is suppressed. An upturn at the lower envelope can occur once the extended disc has been replenished by fresh gas and a new compaction can be triggered, namely as long as the replenishment time is shorter than the depletion time. The mechanisms of gas compaction, depletion, and replenishment confine the SFGs to the narrow (±0.3 dex) MS. Full quenching occurs in massive haloes (Mvir {\textgreater} 1011.5 M⊙) and/or at low redshifts (z {\textless} 3), where the replenishment time is long compared to the depletion time, explaining the observed bending down of the MS at the massive end.},

We find a moderate increase in intrinsic scatter with cosmic time from 0.2 to 0.4 dex across the epoch of peak cosmic star formation. None of our redshift bins show a statistically significant increase in intrinsic scatter at low mass. However, it remains possible that intrinsic scatter increases at low mass on timescales shorter than ∼100 Myr.

Using data from the FourStar Galaxy Evolution Survey (ZFOURGE) in combination with far-IR imaging from the Spitzer and Herschel observatories we measure the SFR-M* relation at 0.5 {\textless} z {\textless} 4. Similar to recent works we find that the average infrared spectral energy distributions of galaxies are roughly consistent with a single infrared template across a broad range of redshifts and stellar masses, with evidence for only weak deviations. We find that the SFR-M* relation is not consistent with a single power law of the form \{SFR\}{\textbackslash}propto \{M\}*α at any redshift; it has a power law slope of α ∼ 1 at low masses, and becomes shallower above a turnover mass (M0) that ranges from 109.5 to 1010.8 M⊙, with evidence that M0 increases with redshift. We compare our measurements to results from state-of-the-art cosmological simulations, and find general agreement in the slope of the SFR-M* relation albeit with systematic offsets. We use the evolving SFR-M* sequence to generate SFHs, finding that typical SFRs of individual galaxies rise at early times and decline after reaching a peak. This peak occurs earlier for more massive galaxies. We integrate these SFHs to generate mass growth histories and compare to the implied mass growth from the evolution of the stellar mass function (SMF). We find that these two estimates are in broad qualitative agreement, but that there is room for improvement at a more detailed level. At early times the SFHs suggest mass growth rates that are as much as 10× higher than inferred from the SMF. However, at later times the SFHs under-predict the inferred evolution, as is expected in the case of additional growth due to mergers.

Based on a sample of 261 galaxies with Hα and Hβ spectroscopy, we have estimated robust dust-corrected instantaneous SFRs over a large range in M* (∼109.5-1011.5 M⊙). We find a correlation between log(SFR(Hα)) and log(M*) with a slope of 0.65 ± 0.08 (0.58 ± 0.10) at 1.4 {\textless} z {\textless} 2.6 (2.1 {\textless} z {\textless} 2.6). We find that different assumptions for the dust correction, such as using the color excess of the stellar continuum to correct the nebular lines, sample selection biases against red star-forming galaxies, and not accounting for Balmer absorption, can yield steeper slopes of the log(SFR)-log(M*) relation. Our sample is immune from these biases as it is rest-frame optically selected, Hα and Hβ are corrected for Balmer absorption, and the Hα luminosity is dust corrected using the nebular color excess computed from the Balmer decrement. The scatter of the log(SFR(Hα))-log(M*) relation, after accounting for the measurement uncertainties, is 0.31 dex at 2.1 {\textless} z {\textless} 2.6, which is 0.05 dex larger than the scatter in log(SFR(UV))-log(M*). Based on comparisons to a simulated SFR-M* relation with some intrinsic scatter, we argue that in the absence of direct measurements of galaxy-to-galaxy variations in the attenuation/extinction curves and the initial mass function, one cannot use the difference in the scatter of the SFR(Hα)- and SFR(UV)-M* relations to constrain the stochasticity of star formation in high-redshift galaxies.},

	abstract = {It is well established that (1) star-forming galaxies follow a relation between their star formation rate (SFR) and stellar mass (\{M\}{\textbackslash}star ), the “star formation sequence,” and (2) the SFRs of galaxies correlate with their structure, where star-forming galaxies are less concentrated than quiescent galaxies at fixed mass. Here, we consider whether the scatter and slope of the star formation sequence is correlated with systematic variations in the Sérsic indices, n, of galaxies across the SFR-\{M\}{\textbackslash}star plane. We use a mass-complete sample of 23,848 galaxies at 0.5 {\textless} z {\textless} 2.5 selected from the 3D-HST photometric catalogs. Galaxy light profiles parameterized by n are based on Hubble Space Telescope Cosmic Assembly Near-IR Deep Extragalactic Legacy Survey near-infrared imaging. We use a single SFR indicator empirically calibrated from stacks of Spitzer/MIPS 24 μm imaging, adding the unobscured and obscured star formation. We find that the scatter of the star formation sequence is related in part to galaxy structure; the scatter due to variations in n at fixed mass for star-forming galaxies ranges from 0.14 ± 0.02 dex at z ∼ 2 to 0.30 ± 0.04 dex at z {\textless} 1. While the slope of the \{log\} \{SFR\}-\{log\} \{M\}{\textbackslash}star relation is of order unity for disk-like galaxies, galaxies with n {\textgreater} 2 (implying more dominant bulges) have significantly lower \{SFR\}/\{M\}{\textbackslash}star than the main ridgeline of the star formation sequence. These results suggest that bulges in massive z ∼ 2 galaxies are actively building up, where the stars in the central concentration are relatively young. At z {\textless} 1, the presence of older bulges within star-forming galaxies lowers global \{SFR\}/\{M\}{\textbackslash}star , decreasing the slope and contributing significantly to the scatter of the star formation sequence.},

It is the first time that these relations can be followed over such a large redshift range from a single homogeneously selected sample of galaxies with spectroscopic redshifts. The log (SFR) - log (M{\textless}SUB{\textgreater}⋆{\textless}/SUB{\textgreater}) relation for SFGs remains roughly linear all the way up to z = 5, but the SFR steadily increases at fixed mass with increasing redshift. We find that for stellar masses M{\textless}SUB{\textgreater}⋆{\textless}/SUB{\textgreater} ≥ 3.2 × 10{\textless}SUP{\textgreater}9{\textless}/SUP{\textgreater}M{\textless}SUB{\textgreater}⊙{\textless}/SUB{\textgreater} the SFR increases by a factor of {\textasciitilde}13 between z = 0.4 and z = 2.3. Weextend this relation up to z = 5, finding an additional increase in SFR by a factor of 1.7 from z = 2.3 to z = 4.8 for masses M{\textless}SUB{\textgreater}⋆{\textless}/SUB{\textgreater} ≥ 10{\textless}SUP{\textgreater}10{\textless}/SUP{\textgreater}M{\textless}SUB{\textgreater}⊙{\textless}/SUB{\textgreater}. We observe a turn-off in the SFR-M{\textless}SUB{\textgreater}⋆{\textless}/SUB{\textgreater} relation at the highest mass end up to a redshift z {\textasciitilde} 3.5. We interpret this turn-off as the signature of a strong on-going quenching mechanism and rapid mass growth. The sSFR increases strongly up to z {\textasciitilde} 2, but it grows much less rapidly in 2 \&lt;z\&lt; 5. We find that the shape of the sSFR evolution is not well reproduced by cold gas accretion-driven models or the latest hydrodynamical models. Below z {\textasciitilde} 2 these models have a flatter evolution (1 + z){\textless}SUP{\textgreater}Φ{\textless}/SUP{\textgreater} with Φ = 2 - 2.25 compared to the data which evolves more rapidly with Φ = 2.8 ± 0.2.

	abstract = {A growing body of evidence indicates that the star formation rate per unit stellar mass (sSFR) decreases with increasing mass in normal main-sequence star-forming galaxies. Many processes have been advocated as being responsible for this trend (also known as mass quenching), e.g., feedback from active galactic nuclei (AGNs), and the formation of classical bulges. In order to improve our insight into the mechanisms regulating the star formation in normal star-forming galaxies across cosmic epochs, we determine a refined star formation versus stellar mass relation in the local Universe. To this end we use the Hα narrow-band imaging follow-up survey (Hα3) of field galaxies selected from the HI Arecibo Legacy Fast ALFA Survey (ALFALFA) in the Coma and Local superclusters. By complementing this local determination with high-redshift measurements from the literature, we reconstruct the star formation history of main-sequence galaxies as a function of stellar mass from the present epoch up to z = 3. In agreement with previous studies, our analysis shows that quenching mechanisms occur above a threshold stellar mass M{\textless}SUB{\textgreater}knee{\textless}/SUB{\textgreater} that evolves with redshift as ∝ (1 + z){\textless}SUP{\textgreater}2{\textless}/SUP{\textgreater}. Moreover, visual morphological classification of individual objects in our local sample reveals a sharp increase in the fraction of visually classified strong bars with mass, hinting that strong bars may contribute to the observed downturn in the sSFR above M{\textless}SUB{\textgreater}knee{\textless}/SUB{\textgreater}. We test this hypothesis using a simple but physically motivated numerical model for bar formation, finding that strong bars can rapidly quench star formation in the central few kpc of field galaxies. We conclude that strong bars contribute significantly to the red colors observed in the inner parts of massive galaxies, although additional mechanisms are likely required to quench the star formation in the outer regions of massive spiral galaxies. Intriguingly, when we extrapolate our model to higher redshifts, we successfully recover the observed redshift evolution for M{\textless}SUB{\textgreater}knee{\textless}/SUB{\textgreater}. Our study highlights how the formation of strong bars in massive galaxies is an important mechanism in regulating the redshift evolution of the sSFR for field main-sequence galaxies. {\textless}P /{\textgreater}Based on observations taken at the observatory of San Pedro Martir (Baja California, Mexico), belonging to the Mexican Observatorio Astronómico Nacional.},

	abstract = {The star formation histories (SFHs) of dwarf galaxies are thought to be bursty, with large - order of magnitude - changes in the star formation rate on time-scales similar to O-star lifetimes. As a result, the standard interpretations of many galaxy observables (which assume a slowly varying SFH) are often incorrect. Here, we use the SFHs from hydrodynamical simulations to investigate the effects of bursty SFHs on sample selection and interpretation of observables and make predictions to confirm such SFHs in future surveys. First, because dwarf galaxies' star formation rates change rapidly, the mass-to-light ratio is also changing rapidly in both the ionizing continuum and, to a lesser extent, the non-ionizing ultraviolet continuum. Therefore, flux limited surveys are highly biased towards selecting galaxies in the burst phase and very deep observations are required to detect all dwarf galaxies at a given stellar mass. Second, we show that a log10[νLν(1500 Å)/LHα] {\textgreater} 2.5 implies a very recent quenching of star formation and can be used as evidence of stellar feedback regulating star formation. Third, we show that the ionizing continuum can be significantly higher than when assuming a constant SFH, which can affect the interpretation of nebular emission line equivalent widths and direct ionizing continuum detections. Finally, we show that a star formation rate estimate based on continuum measurements only (and not on nebular tracers such as the hydrogen Balmer lines) will not trace the rapid changes in star formation and will give the false impression of a star-forming main sequence with low dispersion.},

	abstract = {Understanding the physical processes that drive star formation is a key challenge for galaxy formation models. In this paper, we study the tight correlation between the star formation rate (SFR) and stellar mass of galaxies at a given redshift, how halo growth influences star formation, and star formation histories of individual galaxies. We study these topics using Illustris, a state-of-the-art cosmological hydrodynamical simulation of galaxy formation. Illustris reproduces the observed relation (the star formation main sequence, SFMS) between SFR and stellar mass at redshifts z = 0 and 4, but at intermediate redshifts of z ≃ 1-2, the simulated SFMS has a significantly lower normalization than reported by observations. The scatter in the relation is consistent with the observed scatter. However, the fraction of outliers above the SFR-stellar mass relation in Illustris is less than that observed. Galaxies with halo masses of ∼1012 M⊙ dominate the SFR density of the Universe, in agreement with the results of abundance matching. Furthermore, more-massive galaxies tend to form the bulk of their stars at high redshift, which indicates that `downsizing' occurs in Illustris. We also studied the star formation histories of individual galaxies, including the use of a principal component analysis decomposition. We find that for fixed stellar mass, galaxies that form earlier have more-massive black holes at z = 0, indicating that star formation and black hole growth are tightly linked processes in Illustris. While many of the properties of normal star-forming galaxies are well reproduced in the Illustris simulation, forming a realistic population of starbursts will likely require higher resolution and probably a more sophisticated treatment of star formation and feedback from stars and black holes.},

	abstract = {The main sequence (MS) of star-forming (SF) galaxies plays a fundamental role in driving galaxy evolution and our efforts to understand it. However, different studies find significant differences in the normalization, slope, and shape of the MS. These discrepancies arise mainly from the different selection criteria adopted to isolate SF galaxies, which may include or exclude galaxies with a specific star formation rate (SFR) substantially below the MS value. To obviate this limitation of all current criteria, we propose an objective definition of the MS that does not rely at all on a pre-selection of SF galaxies. Constructing the 3D SFR-mass-number plot, the MS is then defined as the ridge line of the SF peak, as illustrated with various figures. The advantages of such a definition are manifold. If generally adopted, it will facilitate the inter-comparison of results from different groups using the same SFR and stellar mass diagnostics, or it will highlight the relative systematics of different diagnostics. All of this could help to understand MS galaxies as systems in a quasi-steady state equilibrium and would also provide a more objective criterion for identifying quenching galaxies.},

Using new far-infrared photometry from Herschel-PACS and SPIRE and Spitzer-MIPS 24 μm, along with derived infrared luminosities from the NRK method based on galaxies' locations in the restframe color-color diagram (NUV - r) versus (r - K), we are able to more accurately determine total SFRs for our complete sample. At all redshifts, the relationship between median SFR and M * follows a power law at low stellar masses, and flattens to nearly constant SFR at high stellar masses. We describe a new parameterization that provides the best fit to the main sequence and characterizes the low mass power-law slope, turnover mass, and overall scaling. The turnover in the main sequence occurs at a characteristic mass of about M 0 {\textasciitilde} 1010 M ⊙ at all redshifts. The low mass power-law slope ranges from 0.9-1.3 and the overall scaling rises in SFR as a function of (1 + z)4.12 ± 0.10. A broken power-law fit below and above the turnover mass gives relationships of SFR {\textbackslash}propto M*0.88 +/- 0.06 below the turnover mass and SFR {\textbackslash}propto M*0.27 +/- 0.04 above the turnover mass. Galaxies more massive than M * {\textgreater}{\textasciitilde} 1010 M ⊙ have a much lower average specific star formation rate (sSFR) than would be expected by simply extrapolating the traditional linear fit to the main sequence found for less massive galaxies.},

	abstract = {We introduce the Virgo Consortium's Evolution and Assembly of GaLaxies and their Environments (EAGLE) project, a suite of hydrodynamical simulations that follow the formation of galaxies and supermassive black holes in cosmologically representative volumes of a standard Λ cold dark matter universe. We discuss the limitations of such simulations in light of their finite resolution and poorly constrained subgrid physics, and how these affect their predictive power. One major improvement is our treatment of feedback from massive stars and active galactic nuclei (AGN) in which thermal energy is injected into the gas without the need to turn off cooling or decouple hydrodynamical forces, allowing winds to develop without predetermined speed or mass loading factors. Because the feedback efficiencies cannot be predicted from first principles, we calibrate them to the present-day galaxy stellar mass function and the amplitude of the galaxy-central black hole mass relation, also taking galaxy sizes into account. The observed galaxy stellar mass function is reproduced to ≲ 0.2 dex over the full resolved mass range, 108 {\textless} M*/M⊙ ≲ 1011, a level of agreement close to that attained by semi-analytic models, and unprecedented for hydrodynamical simulations. We compare our results to a representative set of low-redshift observables not considered in the calibration, and find good agreement with the observed galaxy specific star formation rates, passive fractions, Tully-Fisher relation, total stellar luminosities of galaxy clusters, and column density distributions of intergalactic C IV and O VI. While the mass-metallicity relations for gas and stars are consistent with observations for M* ≳ 109 M⊙ (M* ≳ 1010 M⊙ at intermediate resolution), they are insufficiently steep at lower masses. For the reference model, the gas fractions and temperatures are too high for clusters of galaxies, but for galaxy groups these discrepancies can be resolved by adopting a higher heating temperature in the subgrid prescription for AGN feedback. The EAGLE simulation suite, which also includes physics variations and higher resolution zoomed-in volumes described elsewhere, constitutes a valuable new resource for studies of galaxy formation.},

	abstract = {We examine the connection between the observed star-forming sequence (SFR vprop M α) and the observed evolution of the stellar mass function in the range 0.2 {\textless} z {\textless} 2.5. We find that the star-forming sequence cannot have a slope α {\textless}{\textasciitilde} 0.9 at all masses and redshifts because this would result in a much higher number density at 10 {\textless} log (M/M ⊙) {\textless} 11 by z = 1 than is observed. We show that a transition in the slope of the star-forming sequence, such that α = 1 at log (M/M ⊙) {\textless} 10.5 and α = 0.7-0.13z (Whitaker et al.) at log (M/M ⊙) {\textgreater} 10.5, greatly improves agreement with the evolution of the stellar mass function. We then derive a star-forming sequence that reproduces the evolution of the mass function by design. This star-forming sequence is also well described by a broken power law, with a shallow slope at high masses and a steep slope at low masses. At z = 2, it is offset by {\textasciitilde}0.3 dex from the observed star-forming sequence, consistent with the mild disagreement between the cosmic star formation rate (SFR) and recent observations of the growth of the stellar mass density. It is unclear whether this problem stems from errors in stellar mass estimates, errors in SFRs, or other effects. We show that a mass-dependent slope is also seen in other self-consistent models of galaxy evolution, including semianalytical, hydrodynamical, and abundance-matching models. As part of the analysis, we demonstrate that neither mergers nor hidden low-mass quiescent galaxies are likely to reconcile the evolution of the mass function and the star-forming sequence. These results are supported by observations from Whitaker et al.},

	abstract = {It has been argued that the specific star formation rates of star-forming galaxies inferred from observational data decline more rapidly below z = 2 than is predicted by hierarchical galaxy formation models. We present a detailed analysis of this problem by comparing predictions from the GALFORM semi-analytic model with an extensive compilation of data on the average star formation rates of star-forming galaxies. We also use this data to infer the form of the stellar mass assembly histories of star-forming galaxies. Our analysis reveals that the currently available data favour a scenario where the stellar mass assembly histories of star-forming galaxies rise at early times and then fall towards the present day. In contrast, our model predicts stellar mass assembly histories that are almost flat below z = 2 for star-forming galaxies, such that the predicted star formation rates can be offset with respect to the observational data by factors of up to 2-3. This disagreement can be explained by the level of coevolution between stellar and halo mass assembly that exists in contemporary galaxy formation models. In turn, this arises because the standard implementations of star formation and supernova feedback used in the models result in the efficiencies of these process remaining approximately constant over the lifetime of a given star-forming galaxy. We demonstrate how a modification to the time-scale for gas ejected by feedback to be reincorporated into galaxy haloes can help to reconcile the model predictions with the data.},

We select quiescent galaxies on the basis of the widely used UVJ color-color criteria. Spectral energy distribution (SED) fitting (rest-frame optical and near-IR) indicates very low SFRs for quiescent galaxies (sSFR {\textasciitilde} 10-12 yr-1). However, SED fitting can miss star formation if it is hidden behind high dust obscuration and ionizing radiation is re-emitted in the mid-infrared. It is therefore fundamental to measure the dust-obscured SFRs with a mid-IR indicator. We stack the MIPS 24 μm images of quiescent objects in five redshift bins centered on z = 0.5, 0.9, 1.2, 1.7, 2.2 and perform aperture photometry. Including direct 24 μm detections, we find sSFR {\textasciitilde} 10-11.9 × (1 + z)4 yr-1. These values are higher than those indicated by SED fitting, but at each redshift they are 20-40 times lower than those of typical star-forming galaxies. The true SFRs of quiescent galaxies might be even lower, as we show that the mid-IR fluxes can be due to processes unrelated to ongoing star formation, such as cirrus dust heated by old stellar populations and circumstellar dust. Our measurements show that star formation quenching is very efficient at every redshift. The measured SFR values are at z {\textgreater} 1.5 marginally consistent with the ones expected from gas recycling (assuming that mass loss from evolved stars refuels star formation) and well below that at lower redshifts.},

For the first time, we find that the slope is dependent on stellar mass, such that it is steeper at low masses (log Ψvproplog M sstarf) than at high masses (log Ψvprop(0.3-0.6)log M sstarf). These steeper low-mass slopes are found for three different star formation indicators: the combination of the ultraviolet (UV) and infrared (IR), calibrated from a stacking analysis of Spitzer/MIPS 24 μm imaging; β-corrected UV SFRs; and Hα SFRs. The normalization of the sequence evolves differently in distinct mass regimes as well: for galaxies less massive than log (M sstarf/M ⊙) {\textless} 10 the specific SFR (Ψ/M sstarf) is observed to be roughly self-similar with Ψ/M sstarfvprop(1 + z)1.9, whereas more massive galaxies show a stronger evolution with Ψ/M sstarfvprop(1 + z)2.2-3.5 for log (M sstarf/M ⊙) = 10.2-11.2.

Exploiting the very latest multifrequency supporting data, we find that this sample displays a redshift distribution indistinguishable from that of the lensed sources uncovered with the South Pole Telescope, with zmedian ≃ 3.5. We also find that, over the redshift range z ≃ 2-6, the median stellar mass of the most luminous (sub-) mm sources is M* ≃ 3 × 1011 M⊙, yielding a typical specific star formation rate sSFR ≃ 3 Gyr- 1. Consistent with recent ALMA and the Submillimeter Array studies, we confirm that source blending is not a serious issue in the study of luminous (sub-) mm sources uncovered by ground-based, single-dish surveys; only ≃10-15 per cent of bright (S850 ≃ 5-10 mJy) (sub-) mm sources arise from significant (i.e. {\textgreater}20 per cent) blends, and so our conclusions are largely unaffected by whether we adopt the original single-dish mm/sub-mm flux densities/positions or the interferometric data. Our results suggest that apparent disagreements over the redshift distribution of (sub-)mm sources are a result of `down-sizing' in dust-enshrouded star formation, consistent with existing knowledge of the star formation histories of massive galaxies. They also indicate that extreme star-forming galaxies at high redshift are, on average, subject to the same star formation rate-limiting processes as less luminous objects, and lie on the `main sequence' of star-forming galaxies at z {\textgreater} 3.},

By fitting for time evolution of the MS in bins of constant mass, we deconvolve the observed scatter about the MS within each observed redshift bin. After accounting for observed scatter between different SFR indicators, we find the width of the MS distribution is {\textasciitilde}0.2 dex and remains constant over cosmic time. Our best fits indicate the slope of the MS is likely time-dependent, with our best-fit log SFR(M *, t) = (0.84 ± 0.02 - 0.026 ± 0.003 × t)log M * - (6.51 ± 0.24 - 0.11 ± 0.03 × t), where t is the age of the universe in Gyr. We use our fits to create empirical evolutionary tracks in order to constrain MS galaxy star formation histories (SFHs), finding that (1) the most accurate representations of MS SFHs are given by delayed-τ models, (2) the decline in fractional stellar mass growth for a "typical" MS galaxy today is approximately linear for most of its lifetime, and (3) scatter about the MS can be generated by galaxies evolving along identical evolutionary tracks assuming an initial 1σ spread in formation times of {\textasciitilde}1.4 Gyr.},

According to this model, the scatter ultimately arises from the intrinsic scatter in the accretion rate, but may be substantially reduced depending on the time-scale on which the accretion varies compared to the time-scale on which the galaxy loses gas mass. This model naturally produces an anticorrelation between star formation and metallicity at a fixed mass, the basis of the fundamental metallicity relation. We show that observational constraints on the scatter in galaxy scaling relations can be translated into constraints on the galaxy-to-galaxy variation in the mass loading factor at fixed mass, and the time-scales and magnitude of a stochastic component of accretion on to star-forming galaxies. We find a remarkably small scatter in the mass loading factor, ≲ 0.1 dex, and that the scatter in accretion rates is smaller than that expected from N-body simulations.},

The simulation includes a blastwave scheme for supernova feedback, a star-formation recipe based on a high gas density threshold, metal-dependent radiative cooling, a scheme for the turbulent diffusion of metals and thermal energy, and a uniform UV background. The properties of the simulated dwarfs are strongly modulated by the depth of the gravitational potential well. All three halos with M vir {\textless} 109 M ⊙ are devoid of stars, as they never reach the density threshold for star formation of 100 atoms cm-3. The other four, M vir {\textgreater} 109 M ⊙ dwarfs have blue colors, low star-formation efficiencies, high cold gas-to-stellar mass ratios, and low stellar metallicities. Their bursty star-formation histories are characterized by peak specific star-formation rates in excess of 50-100 Gyr-1, far outside the realm of normal, more massive galaxies. The median stellar age of the simulated galaxies decreases with decreasing halo mass, with the two M vir {\textasciitilde}= 2-3 × 109 M ⊙ dwarfs being predominantly young, and the two more massive systems hosting intermediate and older populations. The cosmologically young dwarfs are lit up by tidal interactions, have compact morphologies, and have metallicities and cold gas fractions similar to the relatively quiescent, extremely metal-deficient dwarf population. Metal-enriched galactic outflows produce sub-solar effective yields and pollute with heavy elements a megaparsec-size region of the intergalactic medium, but are not sufficient to completely quench star-formation activity and are absent in the faintest dwarfs.},

	abstract = {Using a state-of-the-art semi analytic model for galaxy formation, we investigated in detail the effects of black hole (BH) accretion triggered by disk instabilities (DI) in isolated galaxies on the evolution of the AGN population. Specifically, we took on, developed, and expanded the Hopkins \&amp; Quataert (2011, MNRAS, 411, 1027) model for the mass inflow following disk perturbations, based on a physical description of nuclear inflows and tested against aimed N-body simulations. We compared the evolution of AGN due to such a DI accretion mode with that arising in a scenario where galaxy interactions (IT mode) produce the sudden destabilization of large quantities of gas feeding the AGN; this constitutes the standard AGN feeding mode implemented in the earliest versions of most semi-analytic models. To study the maximal contribution of DI to the evolution of the AGN population, we extended and developed the DI model to assess the effects of changing the assumed disk surface density profile, and to obtain lower limits for the nuclear star formation rates associated to the DI accretion mode. We obtained the following results: i) For AGN with luminosity M{\textless}SUB{\textgreater}1450{\textless}/SUB{\textgreater} ≳ - 26, the DI mode can provide the BH accretion needed to match the observed AGN luminosity functions up to z ≈ 4.5. In such a luminosity range and redshift, it constitutes a viable candidate mechanism to fuel AGN, and can compete with the IT scenario as the main driver of cosmological evolution of the AGN population. ii) The DI scenario cannot provide the observed abundance of high-luminosity QSO with M{\textless}SUB{\textgreater}1450{\textless}/SUB{\textgreater} ≤ -26 AGN, as well as the abundance of high-redhshift z ≳ 4.5 QSO with M{\textless}SUB{\textgreater}1450{\textless}/SUB{\textgreater} ≤ -24. As found in our earliest works, the IT scenario provides an acceptable match to the observed luminosity functions up to z ≈ 6. iii) The dispersion of the distributions of Eddington ratio λ for low- and intermediate-luminosity AGN (bolometric L{\textless}SUB{\textgreater}AGN{\textless}/SUB{\textgreater} = 10{\textless}SUP{\textgreater}43{\textless}/SUP{\textgreater}-10{\textless}SUP{\textgreater}45{\textless}/SUP{\textgreater} erg s{\textless}SUP{\textgreater}-1{\textless}/SUP{\textgreater}) is predicted to be much smaller in the DI scenario compared to the IT mode. iv) The above conclusions concerning the DI mode are robust with respect to the explored variants of the DI model. We discuss the physical origin of our findings. Finally, we discuss how it is possible to pin down the dominant fueling mechanism of AGN in the low-intermediate luminosity range M{\textless}SUB{\textgreater}1450{\textless}/SUB{\textgreater} ≳ -26 where the DI and the IT modes are both viable candidates as the main drivers of the AGN evolution. We show that an interesting discriminant could be provided by the fraction of AGN with high Eddington ratios λ ≥ 0.5, since it increases with luminosity in the IT case, while the opposite is true in the DI scenario. {\textless}P /{\textgreater}Appendices are available in electronic form at {\textless}A href="http://www.aanda.org/10.1051/0004-6361/201424217/olm"{\textgreater}http://www.aanda.org{\textless}/A{\textgreater}},

	abstract = {Over the past two decades, an avalanche of new data from multiwavelength imaging and spectroscopic surveys has revolutionized our view of galaxy formation and evolution. Here we review the range of complementary techniques and theoretical tools that allow astronomers to map the cosmic history of star formation, heavy element production, and reionization of the Universe from the cosmic “dark ages” to the present epoch. A consistent picture is emerging, whereby the star-formation rate density peaked approximately 3.5 Gyr after the Big Bang, at z≈1.9, and declined exponentially at later times, with an e-folding timescale of 3.9 Gyr. Half of the stellar mass observed today was formed before a redshift z = 1.3. About 25\% formed before the peak of the cosmic star-formation rate density, and another 25\% formed after z = 0.7. Less than ∼1\% of today's stars formed during the epoch of reionization. Under the assumption of a universal initial mass function, the global stellar mass density inferred at any epoch matches reasonably well the time integral of all the preceding star-formation activity. The comoving rates of star formation and central black hole accretion follow a similar rise and fall, offering evidence for coevolution of black holes and their host galaxies. The rise of the mean metallicity of the Universe to about 0.001 solar by z = 6, one Gyr after the Big Bang, appears to have been accompanied by the production of fewer than ten hydrogen Lyman-continuum photons per baryon, a rather tight budget for cosmological reionization.},

	abstract = {The slope of the star formation rate/stellar mass relation (the SFR "Main Sequence"; SFR-M *) is not quite unity: specific star formation rates (SFR/M *) are weakly but significantly anti-correlated with M *. Here we demonstrate that this trend may simply reflect the well-known increase in bulge mass-fractions—portions of a galaxy not forming stars—with M *. Using a large set of bulge/disk decompositions and SFR estimates derived from the Sloan Digital Sky Survey, we show that re-normalizing SFR by disk stellar mass (sSFRdisk ≡ SFR/M *, disk) reduces the M * dependence of SF efficiency by {\textasciitilde}0.25 dex per dex, erasing it entirely in some subsamples. Quantitatively, we find log sSFRdisk-log M * to have a slope βdisk in [ - 0.20, 0.00] ± 0.02 (depending on the SFR estimator and Main Sequence definition) for star-forming galaxies with M * {\textgreater}= 1010 M ⊙ and bulge mass-fractions B/T {\textless}{\textasciitilde} 0.6, generally consistent with a pure-disk control sample (βcontrol = -0.05 ± 0.04). That langSFR/M *, diskrang is (largely) independent of host mass for star-forming disks has strong implications for aspects of galaxy evolution inferred from any SFR-M * relation, including manifestations of "mass quenching" (bulge growth), factors shaping the star-forming stellar mass function (uniform dlog M */dt for low-mass, disk-dominated galaxies), and diversity in star formation histories (dispersion in SFR(M *, t)). Our results emphasize the need to treat galaxies as composite systems—not integrated masses—in observational and theoretical work.},

	abstract = {Growing observational evidence indicates that nebular line emission has a significant impact on the rest-frame optical fluxes of z {\textasciitilde} 5-7 galaxies. This line emission makes z {\textasciitilde} 5-7 galaxies appear more massive, with lower specific star-formation rates (sSFRs). However, corrections for this line emission have been difficult to perform reliably because of huge uncertainties on the strength of such emission at z {\textgreater}{\textasciitilde} 5.5. In this paper, we present the most direct observational evidence thus far for ubiquitous high-equivalent-width (EW) [O III] + Hβ line emission in Lyman-break galaxies at z {\textasciitilde} 7, and we present a strategy for an improved measurement of the sSFR at z {\textasciitilde} 7. We accomplish this through the selection of bright galaxies in the narrow redshift window z {\textasciitilde} 6.6-7.0 where the Spitzer/Infrared Array Camera (IRAC) 4.5 μm flux provides a clean measurement of the stellar continuum light, in contrast with the 3.6 μm flux, which is contaminated by the prominent [O III] + Hβ lines. To ensure a high signal-to-noise ratio for our IRAC flux measurements, we consider only the brightest (H 160 {\textless} 26 mag) magnified galaxies we have identified behind galaxy clusters. It is remarkable that the mean rest-frame optical color for our bright seven-source sample is very blue, [3.6]-[4.5] = -0.9 ± 0.3. Such blue colors cannot be explained by the stellar continuum light and require that the rest-frame EW of [O III] + Hβ is greater than 637 Å for the average source. The four bluest sources from our seven-source sample require an even more extreme EW of 1582 Å. We can also set a robust lower limit of {\textgreater}{\textasciitilde} 4 Gyr-1 on the sSFR of our sample based on the mean spectral energy distribution.},

To gain insight on the mass assembly and place constraints on the star formation history (SFH) of Lyman break galaxies (LBGs), it is important to accurately determine their properties. {\textless}BR /{\textgreater} Aims: We estimate how nebular emission and different SFHs affect parameter estimation of LBGs. {\textless}BR /{\textgreater} Methods: We present a homogeneous, detailed analysis of the spectral energy distribution (SED) of {\textasciitilde}1700 LBGs from the GOODS-MUSIC catalogue with deep multi-wavelength photometry from the U band to 8 μm to determine stellar mass, age, dust attenuation, and star formation rate. Using our SED fitting tool, which takes into account nebular emission, we explore a wide parameter space. We also explore a set of different star formation histories. {\textless}BR /{\textgreater} Results: Nebular emission is found to significantly affect the determination of the physical parameters for the majority of z {\textasciitilde} 3-6 LBGs. We identify two populations of galaxies by determining the importance of the contribution of emission lines to broadband fluxes. We find that {\textasciitilde}65\% of LBGs show detectable signs of emission lines, whereas {\textasciitilde}35\% show weak or no emission lines. This distribution is found over the entire redshift range. We interpret these groups as actively star-forming and more quiescent LBGs, respectively. We find that it is necessary to considerer SED fits with very young ages (\&lt;50 Myr) to reproduce some colours affected by strong emission lines. Other arguments favouring episodic star formation and relatively short star formation timescales are also discussed. Considering nebular emission generally leads to a younger age, lower stellar mass, higher dust attenuation, higher star formation rate, and a large scatter in the SFR-M{\textless}SUB{\textgreater}⋆{\textless}/SUB{\textgreater} relation. Our analysis yields a trend of increasing specific star formation rate with redshift, as predicted by recent galaxy evolution models. {\textless}BR /{\textgreater} Conclusions: The physical parameters of approximately two thirds of high redshift galaxies are significantly modified when we account for nebular emission. The SED models, which include nebular emission shed new light on the properties of LBGs with numerous important implications. {\textless}P /{\textgreater}Appendix A is available in electronic form at {\textless}A href="http://www.aanda.org/10.1051/0004-6361/201220026/olm"{\textgreater}http://www.aanda.org{\textless}/A{\textgreater}},

We find strong evolution in the SFR function, with the typical SFR of SFGs declining exponentially in the last 11 Gyr as SFR*(T[Gyr]) = 104.23/T + 0.37 M⊙ yr-1, but with no evolution in the faint-end slope, α ≈ -1.6. The stellar mass function of SFGs, however, reveals little evolution: α ≈ -1.4, M* ∼ 1011.2 ± 0.2 M⊙ and just a slight increase of ∼2.3× in Φ* from z = 2.23 to z = 0.4. The stellar mass density within SFGs has been roughly constant since z = 2.23 at ∼107.65 ± 0.08 M⊙ Mpc-3, comprising ≈100 per cent of the stellar mass density in all galaxies at z = 2.23, and declining to ≈20 per cent by z = 0.40, driven by the rise of the passive population. We find that SFGs with ∼1010.0 ± 0.2 M⊙ contribute most to the SFR density (ρSFR) per d log10M, and that there is no significant evolution in the fractional contribution from SFGs of different masses to ρSFR or ρSFR(d log10M)-1 since z = 2.23. Instead, we show that the decline of SFR* and of ρSFR is primarily driven by an exponential decline in SFRs at all masses. Our results have important implications not only on how SFGs need to be quenched across cosmic time, but also on the driver(s) of the exponential decline in SFR* from ∼66 M⊙ yr-1 to 5 M⊙ yr-1 since z ∼ 2.23.},

Dust extinction is derived from the observed UV colors. We evaluate different star formation histories (SFHs, constant and rising with time) and the impact of optical emission lines. The SFR and M stellar values are insensitive to whether the SFH is constant or rising. The derived sSFR is very similar (within 0.1 dex) in two M stellar bins centered at 1 and 5 × 109 M ⊙. The effect of emission lines was, however, quite pronounced. Assuming no contribution from emission lines, the sSFR for galaxies at 5 × 109 M ⊙ evolves weakly at z {\textgreater} 2 (sSFR(z)vprop(1 + z)0.6 ± 0.1), consistent with previous results. When emission lines are included in the rest-frame optical bands, consistent with the observed Infrared Array Camera [3.6] and [4.5] fluxes, the sSFR shows higher values at high redshift following sSFR(z)vprop(1 + z)1.0 ± 0.1, i.e., the best-fit evolution shows a sSFR {\textasciitilde}2.3 × higher at z {\textasciitilde} 6 than at z {\textasciitilde} 2.

We consider the effects of a wide range of uncertainties on our results, including those affecting stellar masses, SFRs, and the halo mass function at the heart of our analysis. As they are relevant to our method, we also present new calibrations of the dark matter halo mass function, halo mass accretion histories, and halo-subhalo merger rates out to z = 8. We also provide new compilations of CSFRs and SSFRs; more recent measurements are now consistent with the buildup of the cosmic stellar mass density at all redshifts. Implications of our work include: halos near 1012 M ⊙ are the most efficient at forming stars at all redshifts, the baryon conversion efficiency of massive halos drops markedly after z {\textasciitilde} 2.5 (consistent with theories of cold-mode accretion), the ICL for massive galaxies is expected to be significant out to at least z {\textasciitilde} 1-1.5, and dwarf galaxies at low redshifts have higher stellar mass to halo mass ratios than previous expectations and form later than in most theoretical models. Finally, we provide new fitting formulae for SFHs that are more accurate than the standard declining tau model. Our approach places a wide variety of observations relating to the SFH of galaxies into a self-consistent framework based on the modern understanding of structure formation in ΛCDM.

	abstract = {We present a new statistical method to determine the relationship between the stellar masses of galaxies and the masses of their host dark matter haloes over the entire cosmic history from z ∼ 4 to the present. This multi-epoch abundance matching (MEAM) model self-consistently takes into account that satellite galaxies first become satellites at times earlier than they are observed. We employ a redshift-dependent parametrization of the stellar-to-halo-mass relation to populate haloes and subhaloes in the Millennium simulations with galaxies, requiring that the observed stellar mass functions at several redshifts are reproduced simultaneously. We show that physically meaningful growth of massive galaxies is consistent with these data only if observational mass errors are taken into account. Using merger trees extracted from the dark matter simulations in combination with MEAM, we predict the average assembly histories of galaxies, separating into star formation within the galaxies (in situ) and accretion of stars (ex situ). Our main results are the peak star formation efficiency decreases with redshift from 23 per cent at z = 0 to 9 per cent at z =4 while the corresponding halo mass increases from 1011.8 to 1012.5 M⊙. The star formation rate of central galaxies peaks at a redshift which depends on halo mass; for massive haloes this peak is at early cosmic times while for low-mass galaxies the peak has not been reached yet. In haloes similar to that of the Milky Way about half of the central stellar mass is assembled after z = 0.7. In low-mass haloes, the accretion of satellites contributes little to the assembly of their central galaxies, while in massive haloes more than half of the central stellar mass is formed ex situ with significant accretion of satellites at z {\textless} 2. We find that our method implies a cosmic star formation history and an evolution of specific star formation rates which are consistent with those inferred directly. We present convenient fitting functions for stellar masses, star formation rates and accretion rates as functions of halo mass and redshift.},

	abstract = {The physical properties inferred from the spectral energy distributions (SEDs) of z {\textgreater} 3 galaxies have been influential in shaping our understanding of early galaxy formation and the role galaxies may play in cosmic reionization. Of particular importance is the stellar mass density at early times, which represents the integral of earlier star formation. An important puzzle arising from the measurements so far reported is that the specific star formation rates (sSFRs) evolve far less rapidly than expected in most theoretical models. Yet the observations underpinning these results remain very uncertain, owing in part to the possible contamination of rest-optical broadband light from strong nebular emission lines. To quantify the contribution of nebular emission to broadband fluxes, we investigate the SEDs of 92 spectroscopically confirmed galaxies in the redshift range 3.8 {\textless} z {\textless} 5.0 chosen because the Hα line lies within the Spitzer/IRAC 3.6 μm filter. We demonstrate that the 3.6 μm flux is systematically in excess of that expected from stellar continuum alone, which we derive by fitting the SED with population synthesis models. No such excess is seen in a control sample of spectroscopically confirmed galaxies with 3.1 {\textless} z {\textless} 3.6 in which there is no nebular contamination in the IRAC filters. From the distribution of our 3.6 μm flux excesses, we derive an Hα equivalent width distribution and consider the implications for both the derived stellar masses and the sSFR evolution. The mean rest-frame Hα equivalent width we infer at 3.8 {\textless} z {\textless} 5.0 (270 Å) indicates that nebular emission contributes at least 30\% of the 3.6 μm flux and, by implication, nebular emission is likely to have a much greater impact for galaxies with z {\textasciitilde}= 6-7 where both warm IRAC filters are contaminated. Via our empirically derived equivalent width distribution, we correct the available stellar mass densities and show that the sSFR evolves more rapidly at z {\textgreater} 4 than previously thought, supporting up to a 5× increase between z {\textasciitilde}= 2 and 7. Such a trend is much closer to theoretical expectations. Given our findings, we discuss the prospects for verifying quantitatively the nebular emission line strengths prior to the launch of the James Webb Space Telescope.},

	abstract = {We highlight and discuss the importance of accounting for nebular emission in the SEDs of high redshift galaxies, as lines and continuum emission can contribute significantly or subtly to broad-band photometry. Physical parameters such as the galaxy age, mass, star-formation rate, dust attenuation and others inferred from SED fits can be affected to different extent by the treatment of nebular emission. We analyse a large sample of Lyman break galaxies from z {\textasciitilde} 3-6, and show some main results illustrating e.g. the importance of nebular emission for determinations of the mass-SFR relation, attenuation and age. We suggest that a fairly large scatter in such relations could be intrinsic. We find that the majority of objects ({\textasciitilde} 60-70\%) is better fit with SEDs accounting for nebular emission; the remaining galaxies are found to show relatively weak or no emission lines. Our modeling, and supporting empirical evidence, suggests the existence of two categories of galaxies, ``starbursts'' and ``post-starbursts'' (lower SFR and older galaxies) among the LBG population, and relatively short star-formation timescales.},

The sample contains {\textasciitilde}400 z {\textasciitilde} 4, {\textasciitilde}120 z {\textasciitilde} 5, {\textasciitilde}60 z {\textasciitilde} 6, and 36 z {\textasciitilde} 7 galaxies. Median stacking enables the first comprehensive SED study of very faint high-z galaxies at multiple redshifts (e.g., [3.6] = 27.4 ± 0.1 AB mag for the M 1500 {\textasciitilde} -18 sources at z {\textasciitilde} 4). At z {\textasciitilde} 4, we study the stacked SEDs over a range of 5 mag reaching down to {\textasciitilde}0.06L* z = 4. We use all available SEDs and template fits to derive rest-frame UV-to-optical colors (U - V) at all redshifts and luminosities. We find that this color does not vary significantly with redshift at a fixed luminosity. The UV-to-optical color does show a weak trend with luminosity, becoming redder at higher luminosities. This is most likely due to dust. At z {\textgreater}{\textasciitilde} 5, we find blue [3.6]-[4.5] colors {\textasciitilde} -0.3 mag that are most likely due to rest-frame optical emission lines contributing to the flux in the IRAC filter bandpasses. Such contributions would lower both ages and masses by {\textasciitilde}2 ×. The scatter in our derived SEDs remains large, but the results are most consistent with a lack of any evolution in the SEDs with redshift at a given luminosity. The uniformity of the SEDs suggests a self-similar mode of evolution over a timespan from 0.7 Gyr to 1.5 Gyr after the big bang that encompasses very substantial growth in the stellar mass density in the universe (from {\textasciitilde}4 × 106 to {\textasciitilde}2 × 107 M ⊙ Mpc-3).},

Extensive tests show that our β measurements are only subject to minimal biases. Using a different selection procedure, Dunlop et al. recently found large biases in their β measurements. To reconcile these different results, we simulated both approaches and found that β measurements for faint sources are subject to large biases if the same passbands are used both to select the sources and to measure β. High-redshift galaxies show a well-defined rest-frame UV color-magnitude (CM) relationship that becomes systematically bluer toward fainter UV luminosities. No evolution is seen in the slope of the UV CM relationship in the first 1.5 Gyr, though there is a small evolution in the zero point to redder colors from z {\textasciitilde} 7 to z {\textasciitilde} 4. This suggests that galaxies are evolving along a well-defined sequence in the L UV-color (β) plane (a "star-forming sequence"?). Dust appears to be the principal factor driving changes in the UV color β with luminosity. These new larger β samples lead to improved dust extinction estimates at z {\textasciitilde} 4-7 and confirm that the extinction is essentially zero at low luminosities and high redshifts. Inclusion of the new dust extinction results leads to (1) excellent agreement between the star formation rate (SFR) density at z {\textasciitilde} 4-8 and that inferred from the stellar mass density; and (2) to higher specific star formation rates (SSFRs) at z {\textgreater}{\textasciitilde} 4, suggesting that the SSFR may evolve modestly (by factors of {\textasciitilde}2) from z {\textasciitilde} 4-7 to z {\textasciitilde} 2.

For a subset of 302 galaxies at 1.5 {\textless}= z spec {\textless} 2.6, we perform a detailed comparison of star formation rates (SFRs) determined from spectral energy distribution (SED) modeling (SFRs[SED]) and those calculated from deep Keck UV and Spitzer/MIPS 24 μm imaging (SFRs[IR+UV]). Exponentially declining SFHs yield SFRs[SED] that are 5-10 times lower on average than SFRs[IR+UV], indicating that declining SFHs may not be accurate for typical galaxies at z {\textgreater}{\textasciitilde} 2. The SFRs of z {\textasciitilde} 2-3 galaxies are directly proportional to their stellar masses (M *), with unity slope—a result that is confirmed with Spitzer/IRAC stacks of 1179 UV-faint (\{{\textbackslash}cal R\}{\textgreater}25.5) galaxies—for M * {\textgreater}{\textasciitilde} 5 × 108 M ⊙ and SFRs {\textgreater}{\textasciitilde} 2 M ⊙ yr-1. We interpret this result in the context of several systematic biases that can affect determinations of the SFR-M * relation. The average specific SFRs at z {\textasciitilde} 2-3 are remarkably similar within a factor of two to those measured at z {\textgreater}{\textasciitilde} 4, implying that the average SFH is one where SFRs increase with time. A consequence of these rising SFHs is that (1) a substantial fraction of UV-bright z {\textasciitilde} 2-3 galaxies had faint sub-L* progenitors at z {\textgreater}{\textasciitilde} 4; and (2) gas masses must increase with time from z = 2 to 7, over which time the net cold gas accretion rate—as inferred from the specific SFR and the Kennicutt-Schmidt relation—is {\textasciitilde}2-3 times larger than the SFR. However, if we evolve to higher redshift the SFHs and masses of the halos that are expected to host L* galaxies at z {\textasciitilde} 2, then we find that {\textless}{\textasciitilde} 10\% of the baryons accreted onto typical halos at z {\textgreater}{\textasciitilde} 4 actually contribute to star formation at those epochs. These results highlight the relative inefficiency of star formation even at early cosmic times when galaxies were first assembling. Based, in part, on data obtained at the W. M. Keck Observatory, which is operated as a scientific partnership among the California Institute of Technology, the University of California, and NASA, and made possible by the generous financial support of the W.

	abstract = {We investigate how star-forming galaxies typically assemble their masses at high redshift. Taking advantage of the deep multi-wavelength coverage of the GOODS data set, we select two of the largest samples of high-redshift star-forming galaxies based on their UV colors and measure stellar mass of individual galaxies. We use template-fitting photometry to obtain optimal estimates of the fluxes in lower-resolution ground-based and Spitzer images using prior information about galaxy positions, shapes, and orientations. By combining the data and realistic simulations to understand measurement errors and biases, we make a statistically robust determination of stellar mass function (SMF) of the UV-selected star-forming galaxies at z {\textasciitilde} 4 and 5. We report a broad correlation between stellar mass and UV luminosity, such that more UV-luminous galaxies are, on average, also more massive. However, we show that the correlation has a substantial intrinsic scatter, particularly for UV-faint galaxies, evidenced by the fact there is a non-negligible number of UV faint but massive galaxies. Furthermore, we find that the low-mass end of the SMF does not rise as steeply as the UV luminosity function (αUVLF ≈ - (1.7-1.8) while αSMF ≈ - (1.3-1.4)) of the same galaxies. In a smooth and continuous formation scenario where star formation rates (SFRs) are sustained at the observed rates for a long time, these galaxies would have accumulated more stellar mass (by a factor of ≈3) than observed and therefore the SMF would mirror more closely that of the UV luminosity function. The relatively shallow slope of the SMF is due to the fact that many of the UV-selected galaxies are not massive enough, and therefore are too faint in their rest-frame optical bands, to be detected in the current observations. Our results favor a more episodic formation history in which SFRs of low-mass galaxies vary significantly over cosmic time, a scenario currently favored by galaxy clustering. Our findings for the UV-faint galaxies at high redshift are in contrast with previous studies on more UV-luminous galaxies, which exhibit a tighter SFR-M star correlation. The discrepancy may suggest that galaxies at different luminosities may have different evolutionary paths. Such a scenario presents a nontrivial test to theoretical models of galaxy formation.},

Sloan Digital Sky Survey (SDSS) data are combined with photometric properties derived from Galaxy Evolution Explorer to derive stellar masses (M *) and star formation rates (SFRs) by fitting their UV-optical spectral energy distributions (SEDs). In optical images, many of the ALFALFA dwarfs are faint and of low surface brightness; only 56\% of those within the SDSS footprint have a counterpart in the SDSS spectroscopic survey. A large fraction of the dwarfs have high specific star formation rates (SSFRs), and estimates of their SFRs and M * obtained by SED fitting are systematically smaller than ones derived via standard formulae assuming a constant SFR. The increased dispersion of the SSFR distribution at M * {\textless}{\textasciitilde} 108 M ⊙ is driven by a set of dwarf galaxies that have low gas fractions and SSFRs; some of these are dE/dSphs in the Virgo Cluster. The imposition of an upper H I mass limit yields the selection of a sample with lower gas fractions for their M * than found for the overall ALFALFA population. Many of the ALFALFA dwarfs, particularly the Virgo members, have H I depletion timescales shorter than a Hubble time. An examination of the dwarf galaxies within the full ALFALFA population in the context of global star formation (SF) laws is consistent with the general assumptions that gas-rich galaxies have lower SF efficiencies than do optically selected populations and that H I disks are more extended than stellar ones.

Despite the tentative nature of the data, their marked conflict with theory motivates a study of the possible implications. The plateau at sSFR ∼ 2 Gyr-1 is hard to reproduce because (a) its level is low compared to the cosmological specific accretion rate at z≥ 6, (b) it is higher than the latter at z∼ 2, (c) the natural correlation between SFR and stellar mass makes it difficult to manipulate their ratio, and (d) a low SFR at a high z makes it hard to produce enough massive galaxies by z∼ 2. Using a flexible semi-analytic model, we explore ad hoc modifications to the standard physical recipes trying to obey the puzzling observational constraints. Successful models involve non-trivial modifications, such as (a) a suppressed SFR at z≥ 4 in galaxies of all masses, by enhanced feedback or reduced SFR efficiency, following an initial active phase at z {\textgreater} 7; (b) a delayed gas consumption into stars, allowing the gas that was prohibited from forming stars or ejected at high z to form stars later in more massive galaxies; and (c) enhanced growth of massive galaxies, in terms of either faster assembly or more efficient starbursts in mergers, or by efficient star formation in massive haloes.},

	abstract = {Cosmological hydrodynamic simulations robustly predict that high-redshift galaxy star formation histories (SFHs) are smoothly rising and vary with mass only by a scalefactor. We use our latest simulations to test whether this scenario can account for recent observations at z≥ 6 from WFC3/IR, NICMOS and IRAC. Our simulations broadly reproduce the observed ultraviolet (UV) luminosity functions and stellar mass densities and their evolution at z= 6-8, all of which are non-trivial tests of the mean SFH. In agreement with observations, simulated galaxies possess blue UV continua owing to young ages (50-150 Myr), low metallicities (0.1-0.5 Z⊙) and low dust columns [E(B-V) ≤ 0.05]. Our predicted Balmer breaks at z= 7, while significant, are ≈0.5 mag weaker than observed even after accounting for nebular line emission, suggesting observational systematic errors and/or numerical resolution limitations. Observations imply a near-unity slope in the stellar mass-star formation rate relation at all z= 6-8, confirming the prediction that SFH shapes are invariant. Dust extinction suppresses the UV luminosity density by a factor of 2-3, with suppression increasing modestly to later times owing to increasing metallicities. Current surveys detect the majority of galaxies with stellar masses exceeding 109 M⊙ and few galaxies less massive than 108.5 M⊙, implying that they probe no more than the brightest ≈30 per cent of the complete star formation and stellar mass densities at z≥ 6. Finally, we demonstrate that there is no conflict between smoothly rising SFHs and recent clustering observations. This is because momentum-driven outflows suppress star formation in low-mass haloes such that the fraction of haloes hosting observable galaxies (the ‘occupancy’) is 0.2-0.4 even though the star formation duty cycle is unity. This leads to many interesting predictions at z≥ 4, among them that (1) optically selected and UV-selected samples largely overlap; (2) few galaxies exhibit significantly suppressed specific star formation rates; and (3) occupancy is constant or increasing with decreasing luminosity. These predictions are in tentative agreement with current observations, but further analysis of existing and upcoming data sets is required in order to test them more thoroughly.},

For late-type galaxies, Vopt {\textasciitilde}= V200 over the velocity range Vopt = 90-260kms-1, and is consistent with Vopt = Vmax,h [the maximum circular velocity of NFW dark matter haloes in the concordance Λ cold dark matter (Λ CDM) cosmology]. However, for early-type galaxies Vopt ≠ V200, with the exception of early-type galaxies with Vopt {\textasciitilde}= 350 kms-1. This is inconsistent with early-type galaxies being, in general, globally isothermal. For low-mass (Vopt {\textless}{\textasciitilde} 250 kms-1) early-types Vopt {\textgreater} Vmax,h, indicating that baryons have modified the potential well, while high-mass (Vopt {\textgreater} rsim 400 kms-1) early-types have Vopt {\textless} Vmax,h. Folding in measurements of the black hole mass-velocity dispersion relation, our results imply that the supermassive black hole-halo mass relation has a logarithmic slope which varies from {\textasciitilde}=1.4 at halo masses of {\textasciitilde}= 1012h-1 Msolar to {\textasciitilde}=0.65 at halo masses of 1013.5h-1 Msolar. The values of Vopt/V200 we infer for the Milky Way (MW) and M31 are lower than the values currently favoured by direct observations and dynamical models. This offset is due to the fact that the MW and M31 have higher Vopt and lower V200 compared to typical late-type galaxies of the same stellar masses. We show that current high-resolution cosmological hydrodynamical simulations are unable to form galaxies which simultaneously reproduce both the Vopt/V200 ratio and the Vopt-Mstar (Tully-Fisher/Faber-Jackson) relation.},

	abstract = {We use a semi-analytic model for disk galaxies to explore the origin of the time evolution and small scatter of the galaxy SFR sequence - the tight correlation between star formation rate (SFR) and stellar mass (Mstar). The steep decline of SFR from z {\textasciitilde} 2 to the present, at fixed Mstar, is a consequence of the following. First, disk galaxies are in a steady state with the SFR following the net (i.e. inflow minus outflow) gas accretion rate. The evolution of the SFR sequence is determined by evolution in the cosmological specific accretion rates, {\textasciitilde} (1 + z)2.25, but is found to be independent of feedback. Although feedback determines the outflow rates, it shifts galaxies along the SFR sequence, leaving its zero-point invariant. Second, the conversion of accretion rate to SFR is materialized through gas density, not gas mass. Although the model SFR is an increasing function of both gas mass fraction and gas density, only the gas densities are predicted to evolve significantly with redshift. Third, star formation is fueled by molecular gas. Since the molecular gas fraction increases monotonically with increasing gas density, the model predicts strong evolution in the molecular gas fractions, increasing by an order of magnitude from z = 0 to z {\textasciitilde} 2. On the other hand, the model predicts that the effective surface density of atomic gas is , independent of redshift, stellar mass or feedback. Our model suggests that the scatter in the SFR sequence reflects variations in the gas accretion history, and thus is insensitive to stellar mass, redshift or feedback. The large scatter in halo spin contributes negligibly, because it scatters galaxies along the SFR sequence. An observational consequence of this is that the scatter in the SFR sequence is independent of the size (both stellar and gaseous) of galaxy disks.},

We combine the very deep optical to near-infrared photometry from the Hubble Space Telescope Advanced Camera for Surveys and NICMOS cameras with mid-infrared Spitzer Infrared Array Camera (IRAC) imaging available through the GOODS program. After carefully removing the flux from contaminating foreground sources, we have obtained reliable photometry in the 3.6 μm and 4.5 μm IRAC channels. The spectral shapes of these sources, including their rest-frame optical colors, strongly support their being at z {\textasciitilde} 7 with a mean photometric redshift of langzrang = 7.2 ± 0.5. We use Bruzual \& Charlot synthetic stellar population models to constrain their stellar masses and star formation histories. We find stellar masses that range over (0.1-12) × 109 M sun and average ages from 20 Myr to 425 Myr with a mean of {\textasciitilde}300 Myr, suggesting that in some of these galaxies most of the stars were formed at z {\textgreater} 8 (and probably at z {\textgreater}{\textasciitilde} 10). The best fits to the observed SEDs are consistent with little or no dust extinction, in agreement with recent results at z {\textasciitilde} 4-8. The star formation rates (SFRs) are in the range from 5 to 20 M sun yr-1. From this sample, we measure an SMD of 6.6+5.4 -3.3 × 105 M sun Mpc-3 to a limit of M UV,AB {\textless} -20 (or 0.4L* z = 3). Combined with a fiducial lower limit for their ages (80 Myr), this implies a maximum SFR density of 0.008 M sun yr-1 Mpc-3. This is well below the critical level needed to reionize the universe at z {\textasciitilde} 8 using standard assumptions. However, this result is based on luminous sources ({\textgreater}L*) and does not include the dominant contribution of the fainter galaxies. Strikingly, we find that the specific SFR is constant from z {\textasciitilde} 7 to z {\textasciitilde} 2 but drops substantially at more recent times.},

	abstract = {We present results of a large survey of the mid-infrared (mid-IR) properties of 248 Lyman Break Galaxies (LBGs) with confirmed spectroscopic redshift using deep Spitzer/Infrared Array Camera (IRAC) observations in six cosmological fields. By combining the new mid-IR photometry with optical and near-infrared observations, we model the spectral energy distributions (SEDs) employing a revised version of the Bruzual and Charlot synthesis population code that incorporates a new treatment of the thermal-pulsating asymptotic giant branch phase (CB07). Our primary aim is to investigate the impact of the AGB phase in the stellar masses of the LBGs, and compare our new results with previous stellar mass estimates. We investigate the stellar mass of the LBG population as a whole and assess the benefits of adding longer wavelengths to estimates of stellar masses for high-redshift galaxies. Based on the new CB07 code, we find that the stellar masses of LBGs are smaller on an average by a factor of {\textasciitilde}1.4 compared to previous estimates. LBGs with 8 and/or 24μm detections show higher masses (M* {\textasciitilde} 1011Msolar) than LBGs faint in the IRAC bands (M* {\textasciitilde} 109Msolar). The ages of these massive LBGs are considerably higher than the rest of the population, indicating that they have been star forming for at least {\textasciitilde}1 Gyr. We also show how the addition of the IRAC bands improves the accuracy of the estimated stellar masses and reduced the scatter on the derived mass-to-light ratios. In particular, we present a tight correlation between the 8μm IRAC band (rest-frame K for galaxies at z {\textasciitilde} 3) and the stellar mass. We calculate the number density of massive (M* {\textgreater} 1011Msolar) LBGs and find it to be Φ = (1.12 +/- 0.4) × 10-5Mpc-3, {\textasciitilde}1.5 times lower than that found by previous studies. Finally, based on ultraviolet-corrected star formation rates (SFRs), we investigate the SFR-stellar mass correlation at z {\textasciitilde} 3, find it similar to the one observed at other redshifts and show that our data place the peak of the evolution of the specific SFR at z {\textasciitilde} 3.},

We study the evolution of the specific star formation rate (sSFR) with redshift in different mass bins from z = 0 to z {\textasciitilde} 3. We find that the sSFR increases with redshift for all masses. The logarithmic increase of the sSFR with redshift is nearly independent of mass, but this cannot yet be verified at the lowest-mass bins at z{\textgreater}0.8, due to incompleteness. We convert the sSFRs to a dimensionless growth rate to facilitate a comparison with a semianalytic galaxy formation model that was implemented on the Millennium Simulation. The model predicts that the growth rates and sSFRs increase similarly with redshift for all masses, consistent with the observations. However, we find that for all masses, the inferred observed growth rates increase more rapidly with redshift than the model predictions. We discuss several possible causes for this discrepancy, ranging from field-to-field variance, conversions to SFR, and shape of the initial mass function. We find that none of these can solve the discrepancy completely. We conclude that the models need to be adapted to produce the steep increase in growth rate between redshift z = 0 and z = 1.},

It is shown that small systematic differences in SFR dramatically amplify in the course of time: galaxies with above-average SFR run into quasi-exponential mass and SFR growth, while galaxies with below-average SFR avoid such exponential growth and evolve with moderate mass increase. It is argued that galaxies following the first path would enormously overgrow if they keep forming stars all the way to the present, hence should quench star formation and turn passive. By the same token, those instead avoiding the quasi-exponential growth may keep forming stars up to the present. Thus, it is conjectured that this divergent behaviour can help us to understand the origin of the dichotomy between passive, spheroidal galaxies and star-forming, disc galaxies.},

We describe how the catalog has been extended by the addition of mid-IR fluxes derived from the MIPS 24 μm image. We compared two different estimators of the star formation rate (SFR hereafter). One is the total infrared emission derived from 24 μm, estimated using both synthetic and empirical IR templates. The other one is a multiwavelength fit to the full galaxy SED, which automatically accounts for dust reddening and age-star formation activity degeneracies. For both estimates, we computed the SFR density and the specific SFR. {\textless}BR /{\textgreater}Results: We show that the two SFR indicators are roughly consistent, once the uncertainties involved are taken into account. However, they show a systematic trend, IR-based estimates exceeding the fit-based ones as the star formation rate increases. With this new catalog, we show that: a) at z\&gt;0.3, the star formation rate is correlated well with stellar mass, and this relationship seems to steepen with redshift if one relies on IR-based estimates of the SFR; b) the contribution to the global SFRD by massive galaxies increases with redshift up to ≃ 2.5, more rapidly than for galaxies of lower mass, but appears to flatten at higher z; c) despite this increase, the most important contributors to the SFRD at any z are galaxies of about, or immediately lower than, the characteristic stellar mass; d) at z≃ 2, massive galaxies are actively star-forming, with a median \{SFR\} ≃ 300 M\_⊙ yr{\textless}SUP{\textgreater}-1{\textless}/SUP{\textgreater}. During this epoch, our targeted galaxies assemble a substantial part of their final stellar mass; e) the specific SFR (SSFR) shows a clear bimodal distribution. {\textless}BR /{\textgreater}Conclusions: The analysis of the SFR density and the SSFR seems to support the downsizing scenario, according to which high mass galaxies have formed their stars earlier and more rapidly than their low mass counterparts. A comparison with renditions of theoretical simulations of galaxy formation and evolution indicates that these models follow the global increase in the SSFR with redshift and predict the existence of quiescent galaxies even at z\&gt;1.5.

	abstract = {We use a disc galaxy evolution model to investigate the impact of mass outflows (a.k.a. feedback) on disc galaxy scaling relations, mass fractions and spin parameters. Our model follows the accretion, cooling, star formation and ejection of baryonic mass inside growing dark matter haloes, with cosmologically motivated angular momentum distributions, and dark matter halo structure. Models without feedback produce discs that are too small, too gas-poor and which rotate too fast. Feedback reduces the galaxy formation efficiency ɛGF (defined as the fraction of the universally available baryons that end up as stars and cold gas in a given galaxy), resulting in larger discs with higher gas fractions and lower rotation velocities. Models with feedback can reproduce the zero-points of the scaling relations among rotation velocity, stellar mass and disc size, but only in the absence of adiabatic contraction. Our feedback mechanism is maximally efficient in expelling mass, but our successful models require 25 per cent of the supernova (SN) energy or 100 per cent of the SN momentum to drive an outflow. It remains to be seen whether such high efficiencies are realistic or not. Our energy- and momentum-driven wind models result in different slopes of various scaling relations. Energy-driven winds result in steeper slopes to the galaxy-mass-halo-mass and stellar-mass-halo-mass relations, a shallower slope to the galaxy-size-stellar-mass relation at z = 0 and a steeper slope to the cold gas metallicity-stellar-mass relation at z {\textasciitilde}= 2. Observations favour the energy-driven wind at stellar masses below Mstar {\textless}{\textasciitilde} 1010.5Msolar, but the momentum-driven wind model at high masses. The ratio between the specific angular momentum of the baryons to that of the halo (jgal/mgal) is not unity in our models with inflow and outflow. Yet this is the standard assumption in models of disc formation. Above a halo mass of Mvir {\textasciitilde}= 1012Msolar, cooling becomes increasingly inefficient, which results in (jgal/mgal) decreasing with increasing halo mass. Below a halo mass of Mvir {\textasciitilde}= 1012Msolar, feedback becomes increasingly efficient. Feedback preferentially ejects low-angular-momentum material because star formation is more efficient at smaller galactic radii and at higher redshifts. This results in (jgal/mgal) increasing with decreasing halo mass. This effect helps to resolve the discrepancy between the high spin parameters observed for dwarf galaxies with the low spin parameters predicted from Λ cold dark matter.},

We use a sample of BzK-selected star-forming galaxies, drawn from the Cosmic Evolution Survey, to perform a stacking analysis of their 1.4 GHz radio continuum as a function of different stellar population properties, after cleaning the sample from contamination by active galactic nuclei. Dust unbiased SFRs are derived from radio fluxes assuming the local radio-IR correlation. The main results of this work are: (1) specific star formation rate (SSFR)s are constant over about 1 dex in stellar mass and up to the highest stellar mass probed, (2) the dust attenuation is a strong function of galaxy stellar mass with more massive galaxies being more obscured than lower mass objects, (3) a single value of the UV extinction applied to all galaxies would lead to a gross underestimate of the SFR in massive galaxies, (4) correcting the observed UV luminosities for dust attenuation based on the Calzetti recipe provides results in very good agreement with the radio derived ones, (5) the mean SSFR of our sample steadily decreases by a factor of {\textasciitilde}4 with decreasing redshift from z = 2.3 to 1.4 and a factor of {\textasciitilde}40 down the local universe. These empirical SFRs would cause galaxies to dramatically overgrow in mass if maintained all the way to low redshifts; we suggest that this does not happen because star formation is progressively quenched, likely starting from the most massive galaxies.

By utilizing the extensive multiwavelength data sets available in the GOODS fields, we identify 2443 B, 506 V, and 137 i'-band dropout galaxies likely to be at z ≈ 4, 5, and 6. For the subset of dropouts for which reliable Spitzer IRAC photometry is feasible (roughly 35\% of the sample), we estimate luminosity-weighted ages and stellar masses. With the goal of understanding the duration of typical star formation episodes in galaxies at z gsim 4, we examine the distribution of stellar masses and ages as a function of cosmic time. We find that at a fixed rest-UV luminosity, the average stellar masses and ages of galaxies do not increase significantly between z sime 6 and 4. In order to maintain this near equilibrium in the average properties of high-redshift LBGs, we argue that there must be a steady flux of young, newly luminous objects at each successive redshift. When considered along with the short duty cycles inferred from clustering measurements, these results may suggest that galaxies are undergoing star formation episodes lasting only several hundred million years. In contrast to the unchanging relationship between the average stellar mass and rest-UV luminosity, we find that the number density of massive galaxies increases considerably with time over 4 lsim z lsim 6. Given this rapid increase of UV luminous massive galaxies, we explore the possibility that a significant fraction of massive (1011 M sun) z sime 2-3 distant red galaxies (DRGs) were in part assembled in an LBG phase at earlier times. Integrating the growth in the stellar mass function of actively forming LBGs over 4 lsim z lsim 6 down to z sime 2, we find that z gsim 3 LBGs could have contributed significantly to the quiescent DRG population, indicating that the intense star-forming systems probed by submillimeter observations are not the only route toward the assembly of DRGs at z sime 2.},

	abstract = {Massive galaxies in the young Universe, ten billion years ago, formed stars at surprising intensities. Although this is commonly attributed to violent mergers, the properties of many of these galaxies are incompatible with such events, showing gas-rich, clumpy, extended rotating disks not dominated by spheroids. Cosmological simulations and clustering theory are used to explore how these galaxies acquired their gas. Here we report that they are `stream-fed galaxies', formed from steady, narrow, cold gas streams that penetrate the shock-heated media of massive dark matter haloes. A comparison with the observed abundance of star-forming galaxies implies that most of the input gas must rapidly convert to stars. One-third of the stream mass is in gas clumps leading to mergers of mass ratio greater than 1:10, and the rest is in smoother flows. With a merger duty cycle of 0.1, three-quarters of the galaxies forming stars at a given rate are fed by smooth streams. The rarer, submillimetre galaxies that form stars even more intensely are largely merger-induced starbursts. Unlike destructive mergers, the streams are likely to keep the rotating disk configuration intact, although turbulent and broken into giant star-forming clumps that merge into a central spheroid. This stream-driven scenario for the formation of discs and spheroids is an alternative to the merger picture.},

The redshifts are computed with 30 broad, intermediate, and narrowbands covering the UV (Galaxy Evolution Explorer), visible near-IR (NIR; Subaru, Canada-France-Hawaii Telescope (CFHT), United Kingdom Infrared Telescope, and National Optical Astronomy Observatory), and mid-IR (Spitzer/IRAC). A χ2 template-fitting method (Le Phare) was used and calibrated with large spectroscopic samples from the Very Large Telescope Visible Multi-Object Spectrograph and the Keck Deep Extragalactic Imaging Multi-Object Spectrograph. We develop and implement a new method which accounts for the contributions from emission lines ([O II], Hβ, Hα, and Lyα) to the spectral energy distributions (SEDs). The treatment of emission lines improves the photo-z accuracy by a factor of 2.5. Comparison of the derived photo-z with 4148 spectroscopic redshifts (i.e., Δz = z s - z p) indicates a dispersion of σ\_\{Δ z/(1+z\_s)\}=0.007 at i + AB {\textless} 22.5, a factor of 2-6 times more accurate than earlier photo-z in the COSMOS, CFHT Legacy Survey, and the Classifying Object by Medium-Band Observations-17 survey fields. At fainter magnitudes i + AB {\textless} 24 and z {\textless} 1.25, the accuracy is σ\_\{Δ z/(1+z\_s)\}=0.012. The deep NIR and Infrared Array Camera coverage enables the photo-z to be extended to z {\textasciitilde} 2, albeit with a lower accuracy (σ\_\{Δ z/(1+z\_s)\}=0.06 at i + AB {\textasciitilde} 24). The redshift distribution of large magnitude-selected samples is derived and the median redshift is found to range from z m = 0.66 at 22 {\textless} i + AB {\textless} 22.5 to z m = 1.06 at 24.5 {\textless} i + AB {\textless} 25.

This unique multiwavelength data set allows us to investigate the SFR history of massive galaxies out to redshift z {\textasciitilde} 1.8. We determine the SFRs using both the rest-frame ultraviolet luminosity from young, hot stars and the total infrared IR luminosity of obscured star formation obtained from the MIPS 24 μm flux. We find that at all redshifts the galaxies with higher masses have substantially lower specific SFRs (SSFRs) than lower-mass galaxies. The average SSFRs increase with redshift, and the rate of incline is similar for all galaxies (roughly (1 + z) n , n = 5.0 ± 0.4). It does not seem to be a strong function of galaxy mass. Using a subsample of galaxies with masses M * {\textgreater} 1011 M sun, we measured the fraction of galaxies whose star formation is quenched. We consider a galaxy to be in quiescent mode when its SSFR does not exceed 1/(3 × tH ), where tH is the Hubble time. The fraction of quiescent galaxies defined as such decreases with redshift out to z {\textasciitilde} 1.8. We find that, at that redshift, 19\% ± 9\% of the M * {\textgreater} 1011 M sun sources would be considered quiescent according to our criterion.},

	abstract = {We present a simple and efficient empirical algorithm for constructing dark matter halo merger trees that reproduce the distribution of trees in the Millennium cosmological N-body simulation. The generated trees are significantly better than EPS trees. The algorithm is Markovian, and it therefore fails to reproduce the non-Markov features of trees across short time-steps, except for an accurate fit to the evolution of the average main progenitor. However, it properly recovers the full main-progenitor distribution and the joint distributions of all the progenitors over long-enough time-steps, Δω {\textasciitilde}= Δ z {\textgreater} 0.5, where ω {\textasciitilde}= 1.69/D(t) is the self-similar time variable and D(t) refers to the linear growth of density fluctuations. We find that the main-progenitor distribution is lognormal in the variable σ2(M), the variance of linear density fluctuations in a sphere encompassing mass M. The secondary progenitors are successfully drawn one by one from the remaining mass using a similar distribution function. These empirical findings may be clues to the underlying physics of merger-tree statistics. As a byproduct, we provide useful, accurate analytic time-invariant approximations for the main-progenitor accretion history and for halo merger rates.},

We obtain dust-corrected SFRs by fitting the GALEX (ultraviolet) and SDSS photometry to a library of dust-attenuated population synthesis models. For star-forming galaxies, our UV-based SFRs compare remarkably well with those from SDSS-measured emission lines (Hα). Deviations from perfect agreement are shown to be due to differences in the dust attenuation estimates. In contrast to Hα measurements, UV provides reliable SFRs for galaxies with weak Hα, and where Hα is contaminated with AGN emission (1/2 of the sample). Using full-SED SFRs, we calibrate a simple prescription that uses GALEX far- and near-UV magnitudes to produce dust-corrected SFRs for normal star-forming galaxies. The specific SFR is considered as a function of stellar mass for (1) star-forming galaxies with no AGNs, (2) those hosting an AGN, and (3) galaxies without Hα emission. We find that the three have distinct star formation histories, with AGNs lying intermediate between the star-forming and the quiescent galaxies. Star-forming galaxies without an AGN lie on a relatively narrow linear sequence. Remarkably, galaxies hosting a strong AGN appear to represent the massive continuation of this sequence. On the other hand, weak AGNs, while also massive, have lower SFRs, sometimes extending to the realm of quiescent galaxies. We propose an evolutionary sequence for massive galaxies that smoothly connects normal star-forming galaxies to quiescent galaxies via strong and weak AGNs. We confirm that some galaxies with no Hα show signs of star formation in the UV. We derive a cosmic star formation density at z=0.1 with significantly smaller total error than previous measurements.},

For z{\textasciitilde}2 galaxies with moderate luminosities (L8μm{\textless}1011 Lsolar), we find that the SFR can be estimated consistently from the multiwavelength data based on local luminosity correlations. However, 20\%-30\% of massive galaxies, and nearly all those with L8μm{\textgreater}1011 Lsolar, show a mid-IR excess that is likely due to the presence of obscured active nuclei, as shown in a companion paper. There is a tight and roughly linear correlation between stellar mass and SFR for 24 μm-detected galaxies. For a given mass, the SFR at z=2 was larger by a factor of {\textasciitilde}4 and {\textasciitilde}30 relative to that in star-forming galaxies at z=1 and 0, respectively. Typical ultraluminous infrared galaxies (ULIRGs) at z=2 are relatively ``transparent'' to ultraviolet light, and their activity is long lived ({\textgreater}{\textasciitilde}400 Myr), unlike that in local ULIRGs and high-redshift submillimeter-selected galaxies. ULIRGs are the common mode of star formation in massive galaxies at z=2, and the high duty cycle suggests that major mergers are not the dominant trigger for this activity. Current galaxy formation models underpredict the normalization of the mass-SFR correlation by about a factor of 4 and the space density of ULIRGs by an order of magnitude but give better agreement for z{\textgreater}1.4 quiescent galaxies.},

	abstract = {We simulate the build-up of galaxies by spherical gas accretion through dark matter haloes, subject to the development of virial shocks. We find that a uniform cosmological accretion rate turns into a rapidly varying disc build-up rate. The generic sequence of events (Shocked-Accretion Massive Burst and Shutdown, SAMBA) consists of four distinct phases: (i) continuous cold accretion while the halo is below a threshold mass Msh {\textasciitilde} 1012Msolar, (ii) tentative quenching of gas supply for {\textasciitilde}2Gyr, starting abruptly once the halo is {\textasciitilde}Msh and growing a rapidly expanding shock, (iii) a massive burst due to the collapse of {\textasciitilde}1011Msolar gas in {\textasciitilde}0.5Gyr, when the accumulated heated gas cools and joins new infalling gas and (iv) a long-term shutdown, enhanced by a temporary shock instability in late SAMBAs, those that quench at z {\textasciitilde} 2, burst at z {\textasciitilde} 1 and end up quenched in 1012-13Msolar haloes today. The quenching and bursting occur at all redshifts in galaxies of baryonic mass {\textasciitilde}1011Msolar and involve a substantial fraction of this mass. They arise from rather smooth accretion, or minor mergers, which, unlike major mergers, may leave the disc intact while being built in a rapid pace. The early bursts match observed maximum starbursting discs at z {\textgreater}{\textasciitilde} 2, predicted to reside in {\textless}{\textasciitilde}1013Msolar haloes. The late bursts resemble discy luminous infrared galaxies (LIRGs) at z {\textless}{\textasciitilde} 1. On the other hand, the tentative quenching gives rise to a substantial population of {\textasciitilde}1011Msolar galaxies with a strongly suppressed star formation rate at z {\textasciitilde} 1-3. The predicted long-term shutdown leads to red and dead galaxies in groups. A complete shutdown in more massive clusters requires an additional quenching mechanism, as may be provided by clumpy accretion. Alternatively, the SAMBA bursts may trigger the active galactic nucleus (AGN) activity that couples to the hot gas above Msh and helps the required quenching. The SAMBA phenomenon is predicted based on a spherical model that does not simulate star formation and feedback - it is yet to be investigated using detailed cosmological simulations.},

	abstract = {I describe a Bayesian method to account for measurement errors in linear regression of astronomical data. The method allows for heteroscedastic and possibly correlated measurement errors and intrinsic scatter in the regression relationship. The method is based on deriving a likelihood function for the measured data, and I focus on the case when the intrinsic distribution of the independent variables can be approximated using a mixture of Gaussian functions. I generalize the method to incorporate multiple independent variables, nondetections, and selection effects (e.g., Malmquist bias). A Gibbs sampler is described for simulating random draws from the probability distribution of the parameters, given the observed data. I use simulation to compare the method with other common estimators. The simulations illustrate that the Gaussian mixture model outperforms other common estimators and can effectively give constraints on the regression parameters, even when the measurement errors dominate the observed scatter, source detection fraction is low, or the intrinsic distribution of the independent variables is not a mixture of Gaussian functions. I conclude by using this method to fit the X-ray spectral slope as a function of Eddington ratio using a sample of 39 z{\textless}{\textasciitilde}0.8 radio-quiet quasars. I confirm the correlation seen by other authors between the radio-quiet quasar X-ray spectral slope and the Eddington ratio, where the X-ray spectral slope softens as the Eddington ratio increases.

For 2905 field galaxies, complete to 1010(1010.8) Msolar at z{\textless}0.7(1), with Keck spectroscopic redshifts out to z=1.1, we compile SF rates (SFRs) from emission lines, GALEX, and Spitzer MIPS 24 μm photometry, optical-NIR M* measurements, and HST morphologies. Galaxies with reliable signs of SF form a distinct ``main sequence'' (MS), with a limited range of SFRs at a given M* and z (1 σ{\textless}{\textasciitilde}+/-0.3 dex), and log(SFR) approximately proportional to logM*. The range of log(SFR) remains constant to z{\textgreater}1, while the MS as a whole moves to higher SFR as z increases. The range of the SFR along the MS constrains the amplitude of episodic variations of SF and the effect of mergers on the SFR. Typical galaxies spend {\textasciitilde}67\%(95\%) of their lifetime since z=1 within a factor of {\textless}{\textasciitilde}2(4) of their average SFR at a given M* and z. The dominant mode of the evolution of SF since z{\textasciitilde}1 is apparently a gradual decline of the average SFR in most individual galaxies, not a decreasing frequency of starburst episodes, or a decreasing factor by which SFRs are enhanced in starbursts. LIRGs at z{\textasciitilde}1 seem to mostly reflect the high SFR typical for massive galaxies at that epoch. The smooth MS may reflect that the same set of few physical processes governs SF prior to additional quenching processes. A gradual process like gas exhaustion may play a dominant role.},

Standard weighted least-squares fitting is only appropriate when there is a dimension along which the data points have negligible uncertainties, and another along which all the uncertainties can be described by Gaussians of known variance; these conditions are rarely met in practice. We consider cases of general, heterogeneous, and arbitrarily covariant two-dimensional uncertainties, and situations in which there are bad data (large outliers), unknown uncertainties, and unknown but expected intrinsic scatter in the linear relationship being fit. Above all we emphasize the importance of having a "generative model" for the data, even an approximate one. Once there is a generative model, the subsequent fitting is non-arbitrary because the model permits direct computation of the likelihood of the parameters or the posterior probability distribution. Construction of a posterior probability distribution is indispensible if there are "nuisance parameters" to marginalize away.},

	abstract = {Observations have revealed that the star formation rate (SFR) and stellar mass (Mstar) of star-forming galaxies follow a tight relation known as the galaxy main sequence. However, what physical information is encoded in this relation is under debate. Here, we use the EAGLE cosmological hydrodynamical simulation to study the mass dependence, evolution, and origin of scatter in the SFR-Mstar relation. At z = 0, we find that the scatter decreases slightly with stellar mass from 0.35 dex at Mstar ≈ 109 M⊙ to 0.30 dex at Mstar ≳ 1010.5 M⊙. The scatter decreases from z = 0 to z = 5 by 0.05 dex at Mstar ≳ 1010 M⊙ and by 0.15 dex for lower masses. We show that the scatter at z = 0.1 originates from a combination of fluctuations on short time-scales (ranging from 0.2-2 Gyr) that are presumably associated with self-regulation from cooling, star formation, and outflows, but is dominated by long time-scale (∼10 Gyr) variations related to differences in halo formation times. Shorter time-scale fluctuations are relatively more important for lower mass galaxies. At high masses, differences in black hole formation efficiency cause additional scatter, but also diminish the scatter caused by different halo formation times. While individual galaxies cross the main sequence multiple times during their evolution, they fluctuate around tracks associated with their halo properties, i.e. galaxies above/below the main sequence at z = 0.1 tend to have been above/below the main sequence for ≫1 Gyr.},

	abstract = {Parametric models for galaxy star formation histories (SFHs) are widely used, though they are known to impose strong priors on physical parameters. This has consequences for measurements of the galaxy stellar-mass function, star formation rate density (SFRD), and star-forming main sequence (SFMS). We investigate the effects of the exponentially declining, delayed exponentially declining, lognormal, and double power-law SFH models using BAGPIPES. We demonstrate that each of these models imposes strong priors on specific star formation rates (SFRs), potentially biasing the SFMS, and also imposes a strong prior preference for young stellar populations. We show that stellar mass, SFR, and mass-weighted age inferences from high-quality mock photometry vary with the choice of SFH model by at least 0.1, 0.3, and 0.2 dex, respectively. However, the biases with respect to the true values depend more on the true SFH shape than the choice of model. We also demonstrate that photometric data cannot discriminate between SFH models, meaning that it is important to perform independent tests to find well-motivated priors. We finally fit a low-redshift, volume-complete sample of galaxies from the Galaxy and Mass Assembly (GAMA) Survey with each model. We demonstrate that our stellar masses and SFRs at redshift z ∼ 0.05 are consistent with other analyses. However, our inferred cosmic SFRDs peak at z ∼ 0.4, approximately 6 Gyr later than direct observations suggest, meaning that our mass-weighted ages are significantly underestimated. This makes the use of parametric SFH models for understanding mass assembly in galaxies challenging. In a companion paper, we consider nonparametric SFH models.},

We release 1988 spectra with typical continuum S/N ≃ 20 Å-1 of galaxies at 0.6 ≲ z ≲ 1.0, each observed for ∼20 hr and fully reduced with a custom-built pipeline. We also release a catalog with spectroscopic redshifts, emission-line fluxes, Lick/IDS indices, and observed stellar and gas velocity dispersions that are spatially integrated quantities, including both rotational motions and genuine dispersion. To illustrate the new parameter space in the intermediate-redshift regime probed by LEGA-C, we explore relationships between dynamical and stellar population properties. The star-forming galaxies typically have observed stellar velocity dispersions of ∼150 km s-1 and strong Hδ absorption (Hδ A ∼ 5 Å), while passive galaxies have higher observed stellar velocity dispersions (∼200 km s-1) and weak Hδ absorption (Hδ A ∼ 0 Å). Strong [O III]5007/Hβ ratios tend to occur mostly for galaxies with weak Hδ A or galaxies with higher observed velocity dispersion. Beyond these broad trends, we find a diversity of possible combinations of rest-frame colors, absorption-line strengths, and emission-line detections, illustrating the utility of spectroscopic measurements to more accurately understand galaxy evolution. By making the spectra and value-added catalogs publicly available we encourage the community to take advantage of this very substantial investment in telescope time provided by ESO.},

	abstract = {We present Bayesian Analysis of Galaxies for Physical Inference and Parameter EStimation, or BAGPIPES, a new PYTHON tool that can be used to rapidly generate complex model galaxy spectra and to fit these to arbitrary combinations of spectroscopic and photometric data using the MULTINEST nested sampling algorithm. We extensively test our ability to recover realistic star formation histories (SFHs) by fitting mock observations of quiescent galaxies from the MUFASA simulation. We then perform a detailed analysis of the SFHs of a sample of 9289 quiescent galaxies from UltraVISTA with stellar masses, M* {\textgreater} 1010 M⊙ and redshifts 0.25 {\textless} z {\textless} 3.75. The majority of our sample exhibit SFHs that rise gradually then quench relatively rapidly over 1-2 Gyr. This behaviour is consistent with recent cosmological hydrodynamic simulations, where AGN-driven feedback in the low-accretion (jet) mode is the dominant quenching mechanism. At z {\textgreater} 1, we also find a class of objects with SFHs that rise and fall very rapidly, with quenching time-scales of {\textless}1 Gyr, consistent with quasar-mode AGN feedback. Finally, at z {\textless} 1 we find a population with SFHs which quench more slowly than they rise, over {\textgreater}3 Gyr, which we speculate to be the result of diminishing overall cosmic gas supply. We confirm the mass-accelerated evolution (downsizing) trend, and a trend towards more rapid quenching at higher stellar masses. However, our results suggest that the latter is a natural consequence of mass-accelerated evolution, rather than a change in quenching physics with stellar mass. We find 61 ± 8 per cent of z {\textgreater} 1.5 massive-quenched galaxies undergo significant further evolution by z = 0.5. BAGPIPES is available at bagpipes.readthedocs.io.},

	abstract = {VANDELS is a uniquely deep spectroscopic survey of high-redshift galaxies with the VIMOS spectrograph on ESO's Very Large Telescope (VLT). The survey has obtained ultradeep optical (0.48 {\textless} λ {\textless} 1.0 μ m) spectroscopy of ≃2100 galaxies within the redshift interval 1.0 ≤ z ≤ 7.0, over a total area of ≃0.2 deg2 centred on the CANDELS Ultra Deep Survey and Chandra Deep Field South fields. Based on accurate photometric redshift pre-selection, 85 per cent of the galaxies targeted by VANDELS were selected to be at z ≥ 3. Exploiting the red sensitivity of the refurbished VIMOS spectrograph, the fundamental aim of the survey is to provide the high-signal-to-noise ratio spectra necessary to measure key physical properties such as stellar population ages, masses, metallicities, and outflow velocities from detailed absorption-line studies. Using integration times calculated to produce an approximately constant signal-to-noise ratio (20 {\textless} tint{\textless} 80 h), the VANDELS survey targeted: (a) bright star-forming galaxies at 2.4 ≤ z ≤ 5.5, (b) massive quiescent galaxies at 1.0 ≤ z ≤ 2.5, (c) fainter star-forming galaxies at 3.0 ≤ z ≤ 7.0, and (d) X-ray/Spitzer-selected active galactic nuclei and Herschel-detected galaxies. By targeting two extragalactic survey fields with superb multiwavelength imaging data, VANDELS will produce a unique legacy data set for exploring the physics underpinning high-redshift galaxy evolution. In this paper, we provide an overview of the VANDELS survey designed to support the science exploitation of the first ESO public data release, focusing on the scientific motivation, survey design, and target selection.},

	abstract = {This paper describes the observations and the first data release (DR1) of the ESO public spectroscopic survey "VANDELS, a deep VIMOS survey of the CANDELS CDFS and UDS fields". The main targets of VANDELS are star-forming galaxies at redshift 2.4 \&lt; z \&lt; 5.5, an epoch when the Universe had not yet reached 20\% of its current age, and massive passive galaxies in the range 1 \&lt; z \&lt; 2.5. By adopting a strategy of ultra-long exposure times, ranging from a minimum of 20 h to a maximum of 80 h per source, VANDELS is specifically designed to be the deepest-ever spectroscopic survey of the high-redshift Universe. Exploiting the red sensitivity of the refurbished VIMOS spectrograph, the survey is obtaining ultra-deep optical spectroscopy covering the wavelength range 4800-10 000 Å with a sufficiently high signal-to-noise ratio to investigate the astrophysics of high-redshift galaxy evolution via detailed absorption line studies of well-defined samples of high-redshift galaxies. VANDELS-DR1 is the release of all medium-resolution spectroscopic data obtained during the first season of observations, on a 0.2 square degree area centered around the CANDELS-CDFS (Chandra deep-field south) and CANDELS-UDS (ultra-deep survey) areas. It includes data for all galaxies for which the total (or half of the total) scheduled integration time was completed. The DR1 contains 879 individual objects, approximately half in each of the two fields, that have a measured redshift, with the highest reliable redshifts reaching z{\textless}SUB{\textgreater}spec{\textless}/SUB{\textgreater} 6. In DR1 we include fully wavelength-calibrated and flux-calibrated 1D spectra, the associated error spectrum and sky spectrum, and the associated wavelength-calibrated 2D spectra. We also provide a catalog with the essential galaxy parameters, including spectroscopic redshifts and redshift quality flags measured by the collaboration. We present the survey layout and observations, the data reduction and redshift measurement procedure, and the general properties of the VANDELS-DR1 sample. In particular, we discuss the spectroscopic redshift distribution and the accuracy of the photometricredshifts for each individual target category, and we provide some examples of data products for the various target typesand the different quality flags. All VANDELS-DR1 data are publicly available and can be retrieved from the ESO archive. Two further data releases are foreseen in the next two years, and a final data release is currently scheduled for June 2020, which will include an improved rereduction of the entire spectroscopic data set.},

Our model follows observed mass and luminosity functions of both star-forming and quiescent galaxies, and reproduces the redshift evolution of colors, sizes, star formation, and chemical properties of the observed galaxy population. Unlike other existing approaches, our model includes a self-consistent treatment of stellar and photoionized gas emission and dust attenuation based on the BEAGLE tool. The mock galaxy catalogs generated with our new model can be used to simulate and optimize extragalactic surveys with future facilities such as the James Webb Space Telescope (JWST), and to enable critical assessments of analysis procedures, interpretation tools, and measurement systematics for both photometric and spectroscopic data. As a first application of this work, we make predictions for the upcoming JWST Advanced Deep Extragalactic Survey (JADES), a joint program of the JWST/NIRCam and NIRSpec Guaranteed Time Observations teams. We show that JADES will detect, with NIRCam imaging, 1000s of galaxies at z ≳ 6, and 10s at z ≳ 10 at \{m\}\{AB\}≲ 30 (5σ) within the 236 arcmin2 of the survey. The JADES data will enable accurate constraints on the evolution of the UV luminosity function at z {\textgreater} 8, and resolve the current debate about the rate of evolution of galaxies at z ≳ 8.

In line with the first two FF catalogues released by ASTRODEEP, the photometric redshifts reach 4\% accuracy.

	abstract = {We present a method to recover the gas-phase metallicity gradients from integral field spectroscopic (IFS) observations of barely resolved galaxies. We take a forward modelling approach and compare our models to the observed spatial distribution of emission-line fluxes, accounting for the degrading effects of seeing and spatial binning. The method is flexible and is not limited to particular emission lines or instruments. We test the model through comparison to synthetic observations and use downgraded observations of nearby galaxies to validate this work. As a proof of concept, we also apply the model to real IFS observations of high-redshift galaxies. From our testing, we show that the inferred metallicity gradients and central metallicities are fairly insensitive to the assumptions made in the model and that they are reliably recovered for galaxies with sizes approximately equal to the half width at half-maximum of the point spread function. However, we also find that the presence of star-forming clumps can significantly complicate the interpretation of metallicity gradients in moderately resolved high-redshift galaxies. Therefore, we emphasize that care should be taken when comparing nearby well-resolved observations to high-redshift observations of partially resolved galaxies.},

	abstract = {Gladders et al. have recently suggested that the star formation histories (SFHs) of individual galaxies are characterized by a log-normal function in time, implying a slow decline rather than rapid quenching. We test their conjecture on theoretical SFHs from the cosmological simulation Illustris and on observationally inferred SFHs. While the log-normal form necessarily ignores short-lived features such as starbursts, it fits the overall shape of the majority of SFHs very well. In particular, 85\% of the cumulative SFHs are fitted to within a maximum error of 5\% of the total stellar mass formed, and 99\% to within 10\%. The log-normal performs systematically better than the commonly used delayed-τ model, and is superseded only by functions with more than three free parameters. Poor fits are mostly found in galaxies that were rapidly quenched after becoming satellites. We explore the log-normal parameter space of normalization, peak time, and full width at half maximum, and find that the simulated and observed samples occupy similar regions, though Illustris predicts wider, later-forming SFHs on average. The ensemble of log-normal fits correctly reproduces complex metrics such as the evolution of Illustris galaxies across the star formation main sequence, but overpredicts their quenching timescales. SFHs in Illustris are a diverse population not determined by any one physical property of galaxies, but follow a tight relation, where \{width\} {\textbackslash}propto \{(\{peak\}\{time\})\}3/2. We show that such a relation can be explained qualitatively (though not quantitatively) by a close connection between the growth of dark matter halos and their galaxies.},

This is done using basis star formation histories (SFHs) chosen by comparing the goodness-of-fit of mock galaxy SEDs to the goodness-of-reconstruction of their SFHs. We train and validate the method using a sample of realistic SFHs at z = 1 drawn from stochastic realizations, semi-analytic models, and a cosmological hydrodynamical galaxy formation simulation. The method is then applied to a sample of 1100 CANDELS GOODS-S galaxies at 1{\textless} z{\textless} 1.5 to illustrate its capabilities at moderate S/N with 15 photometric bands. Of the six parametrizations of SFHs considered, we adopt linear-exponential, bessel-exponential, log-normal, and Gaussian SFHs, and reject the traditional parametrizations of constant (Top-Hat) and exponential SFHs. We quantify the bias and scatter of each parametrization. 15\% of galaxies in our CANDELS sample exhibit multiple episodes of star formation, with this fraction decreasing above \{M\}* {\textgreater} \{10\}9.5 \{M\}⊙ . About 40\% of the CANDELS galaxies have SFHs whose maximum occurs at or near the epoch of observation.

This is the challenge taken up by the Frontier Fields, a Director’s discretionary time campaign with HST and the Spitzer Space Telescope to see deeper into the universe than ever before. The Frontier Fields combines the power of HST and Spitzer with the natural gravitational telescopes of massive high-magnification clusters of galaxies to produce the deepest observations of clusters and their lensed galaxies ever obtained. Six clusters—Abell 2744, MACSJ0416.1-2403, MACSJ0717.5+3745, MACSJ1149.5+2223, Abell S1063, and Abell 370—have been targeted by the HST ACS/WFC and WFC3/IR cameras with coordinated parallel fields for over 840 HST orbits. The parallel fields are the second-deepest observations thus far by HST with 5σ point-source depths of ∼29th ABmag. Galaxies behind the clusters experience typical magnification factors of a few, with small regions magnified by factors of 10-100. Therefore, the Frontier Field cluster HST images achieve intrinsic depths of ∼30-33 mag over very small volumes. Spitzer has obtained over 1000 hr of Director’s discretionary imaging of the Frontier Field cluster and parallels in IRAC 3.6 and 4.5 μm bands to 5σ point-source depths of ∼26.5, 26.0 ABmag. We demonstrate the exceptional sensitivity of the HST Frontier Field images to faint high-redshift galaxies, and review the initial results related to the primary science goals.},

We search for emission lines in known multiply imaged sources in the GLASS spectra, obtaining secure spectroscopic redshifts of 30 multiple images belonging to 15 distinct source galaxies. The GLASS spectra provide the first spectroscopic measurements for five of the source galaxies. The weak lensing signal is acquired from 884 galaxies in the F606W HFF image. By combining the weak lensing constraints with 15 multiple image systems with spectroscopic redshifts and nine multiple image systems with photometric redshifts, we reconstruct the gravitational potential of the cluster on an adaptive grid. The resulting map of total mass density is compared with a map of stellar mass density obtained from the deep Spitzer Frontier Fields imaging data to study the relative distribution of stellar and total mass in the cluster. We find that the projected stellar mass to total mass ratio, f ⋆, varies considerably with the stellar surface mass density.

	abstract = {We present a new model of the nebular emission from star-forming galaxies in a wide range of chemical compositions, appropriate to interpret observations of galaxies at all cosmic epochs. The model relies on the combination of state-of-the-art stellar population synthesis and photoionization codes to describe the ensemble of H II regions and the diffuse gas ionized by young stars in a galaxy. A main feature of this model is the self-consistent yet versatile treatment of element abundances and depletion on to dust grains, which allows one to relate the observed nebular emission from a galaxy to both gas-phase and dust-phase metal enrichment. We show that this model can account for the rest-frame ultraviolet and optical emission-line properties of galaxies at different redshifts and find that ultraviolet emission lines are more sensitive than optical ones to parameters such as C/O abundance ratio, hydrogen gas density, dust-to-metal mass ratio and upper cut-off of the stellar initial mass function. We also find that, for gas-phase metallicities around solar to slightly subsolar, widely used formulae to constrain oxygen ionic fractions and the C/O ratio from ultraviolet and optical emission-line luminosities are reasonable faithful. However, the recipes break down at non-solar metallicities, making them inappropriate to study chemically young galaxies. In such cases, a fully self-consistent model of the kind presented in this paper is required to interpret the observed nebular emission.},

This flexible tool, named BEAGLE (for BayEsian Analysis of GaLaxy sEds), allows one to build mock galaxy catalogues as well as to interpret any combination of photometric and spectroscopic galaxy observations in terms of physical parameters. The current version of the tool includes versatile modelling of the emission from stars and photoionized gas, attenuation by dust and accounting for different instrumental effects, such as spectroscopic flux calibration and line spread function. We show a first application of the BEAGLE tool to the interpretation of broad-band SEDs of a published sample of ∼ 10{\textasciicircum}4 galaxies at redshifts 0.1 ≲ z ≲ 8. We find that the constraints derived on photometric redshifts using this multipurpose tool are comparable to those obtained using public, dedicated photometric-redshift codes and quantify this result in a rigorous statistical way. We also show how the post-processing of BEAGLE output data with the PYTHON extension PYP-BEAGLE allows the characterization of systematic deviations between models and observations, in particular through posterior predictive checks. The modular design of the BEAGLE tool allows easy extensions to incorporate, for example, the absorption by neutral galactic and circumgalactic gas, and the emission from an active galactic nucleus, dust and shock-ionized gas.

	abstract = {Context. The Frontier Fields survey is a pioneering observational program aimed at collecting photometric data, both from space (Hubble Space Telescope and Spitzer Space Telescope) and from ground-based facilities (VLT Hawk-I), for six deep fields pointing at clusters of galaxies and six nearby deep parallel fields, in a wide range of passbands. The analysis of these data is a natural outcome of the Astrodeep project, an EU collaboration aimed at developing methods and tools for extragalactic photometry and creating valuable public photometric catalogues. {\textless}BR /{\textgreater} Aims: We produce multiwavelength photometric catalogues (from B to 4.5 μm) for the first two of the Frontier Fields, Abell-2744 and MACS-J0416 (plus their parallel fields). {\textless}BR /{\textgreater} Methods: To detect faint sources even in the central regions of the clusters, we develop a robust and repeatable procedure that uses the public codes Galapagos and Galfit to model and remove most of the light contribution from both the brightest cluster members, and the intra-cluster light. We perform the detection on the processed HST H160 image to obtain a pure H-selected sample, which is the primary catalogue that we publish. We also add a sample of sources which are undetected in the H160 image but appear on a stacked infrared image. Photometry on the other HST bands is obtained using SExtractor, again on processed images after the procedure for foreground light removal. Photometry on the Hawk-I and IRAC bands is obtained using our PSF-matching deconfusion code t-phot. A similar procedure, but without the need for the foreground light removal, is adopted for the Parallel fields. {\textless}BR /{\textgreater} Results: The procedure of foreground light subtraction allows for the detection and the photometric measurements of {\textasciitilde}2500 sources per field. We deliver and release complete photometric H-detected catalogues, with the addition of the complementary sample of infrared-detected sources. All objects have multiwavelength coverage including B to H HST bands, plus K-band from Hawk-I, and 3.6-4.5 μm from Spitzer. full and detailed treatment of photometric errors is included. We perform basic sanity checks on the reliability of our results. {\textless}BR /{\textgreater} Conclusions: The multiwavelength photometric catalogues are available publicly and are ready to be used for scientific purposes. Our procedures allows for the detection of outshone objects near the bright galaxies, which, coupled with the magnification effect of the clusters, can reveal extremely faint high redshift sources. Full analysis on photometric redshifts is presented in Paper II. {\textless}P /{\textgreater}The catalogues, together with the final processed images for all HST bands (as well as some diagnostic data and images), are publicly available and can be downloaded from the Astrodeep website at {\textless}A href="http://www.astrodeep.eu/frontier-fields/"{\textgreater}http://www.astrodeep.eu/frontier-fields/{\textless}/A{\textgreater} and from a dedicated CDS webpage ({\textless}A href="http://astrodeep.u-strasbg.fr/ff/index.html"{\textgreater}http://astrodeep.u-strasbg.fr/ff/index.html{\textless}/A{\textgreater}).

All earlier studies have derived this relation from integrated properties of galaxies. We recover the same relation from an analysis of spatially resolved properties, with integral field spectroscopic (IFS) observations of 306 galaxies from the CALIFA survey. We consider the SFR surface density in units of log(M ⊙ yr-1 Kpc-2) and the stellar mass surface density in units of log(M ⊙ Kpc-2) in individual spaxels that probe spatial scales of 0.5-1.5 Kpc. This local relation exhibits a high degree of correlation with small scatter (σ = 0.23 dex), irrespective of the dominant ionization source of the host galaxy or its integrated stellar mass. We highlight (I) the integrated star formation main sequence formed by galaxies whose dominant ionization process is related to star formation, for which we find a slope of 0.81 ± 0.02; (II) for the spatially resolved relation obtained with the spaxel analysis, we find a slope of 0.72 ± 0.04; and (III) for the integrated main sequence, we also identified a sequence formed by galaxies that are dominated by an old stellar population, which we have called the retired galaxies sequence.},

	abstract = {Context. The advent of deep multiwavelength extragalactic surveys has led to the necessity for advanced and fast methods for photometric analysis. In fact, codes which allow analyses of the same regions of the sky observed at different wavelengths and resolutions are becoming essential to thoroughly exploit current and future data. In this context, a key issue is the confusion (i.e. blending) of sources in low-resolution images. {\textless}BR /{\textgreater} Aims: We present t-phot, a publicly available software package developed within the astrodeep project. t-phot is aimed at extracting accurate photometry from low-resolution images, where the blending of sources can be a serious problem for the accurate and unbiased measurement of fluxes and colours. {\textless}BR /{\textgreater} Methods: t-phot can be considered as the next generation to tfit, providing significant improvements over and above it and other similar codes (e.g. convphot). t-phot gathers data from a high-resolution image of a region of the sky, and uses this information (source positions and morphologies) to obtain priors for the photometric analysis of the lower resolution image of the same field. t-phot can handle different types of datasets as input priors, namely i) a list of objects that will be used to obtain cutouts from the real high-resolution image; ii) a set of analytical models (as .fits stamps); iii) a list of unresolved, point-like sources, useful for example for far-infrared (FIR) wavelength domains. {\textless}BR /{\textgreater} Results: By means of simulations and analysis of real datasets, we show that t-phot yields accurate estimations of fluxes within the intrinsic uncertainties of the method, when systematic errors are taken into account (which can be done thanks to a flagging code given in the output). t-phot is many times faster than similar codes like tfit and convphot (up to hundreds, depending on the problem and the method adopted), whilst at the same time being more robust and more versatile. This makes it an excellent choice for the analysis of large datasets. When used with the same parameter sets as for tfit it yields almost identical results (although in a much shorter time); in addition we show how the use of different settings and methods significantly enhances the performance. {\textless}BR /{\textgreater} Conclusions: t-phot proves to be a state-of-the-art tool for multiwavelength optical to far-infrared image photometry. Given its versatility and robustness, t-phot can be considered the preferred choice for combined photometric analysis of current and forthcoming extragalactic imaging surveys. {\textless}P /{\textgreater}t-phot is publicly available for downloading from {\textless}A href="http://www.astrodeep.eu/t-phot/"{\textgreater}http://www.astrodeep.eu/t-phot/{\textless}/A{\textgreater}},

	abstract = {We present an analysis of the deepest Herschel images in four major extragalactic fields GOODS-North, GOODS-South, UDS, and COSMOS obtained within the GOODS-Herschel and CANDELS-Herschel key programs. The star formation picture provided by a total of 10 497 individual far-infrared detections is supplemented by the stacking analysis of a mass complete sample of 62 361 star-forming galaxies from the Hubble Space Telescope (HST) H band-selected catalogs of the CANDELS survey and from two deep ground-based K{\textless}SUB{\textgreater}s{\textless}/SUB{\textgreater} band-selected catalogs in the GOODS-North and the COSMOS-wide field to obtain one of the most accurate and unbiased understanding to date of the stellar mass growth over the cosmic history. We show, for the first time, that stacking also provides a powerful tool to determine the dispersion of a physical correlation and describe our method called "scatter stacking", which may be easily generalized to other experiments. The combination of direct UV and far-infrared UV-reprocessed light provides a complete census on the star formation rates (SFRs), allowing us to demonstrate that galaxies at z = 4 to 0 of all stellar masses (M{\textless}SUB{\textgreater}∗{\textless}/SUB{\textgreater}) follow a universal scaling law, the so-called main sequence of star-forming galaxies. We find a universal close-to-linear slope of the log {\textless}SUB{\textgreater}10{\textless}/SUB{\textgreater}(SFR)-log {\textless}SUB{\textgreater}10{\textless}/SUB{\textgreater}(M{\textless}SUB{\textgreater}∗{\textless}/SUB{\textgreater}) relation, with evidence for a flattening of the main sequence at high masses (log {\textless}SUB{\textgreater}10{\textless}/SUB{\textgreater}(M{\textless}SUB{\textgreater}∗{\textless}/SUB{\textgreater}/M{\textless}SUB{\textgreater}⊙{\textless}/SUB{\textgreater}) \&gt; 10.5) that becomesless prominent with increasing redshift and almost vanishes by z ≃ 2. This flattening may be due to the parallel stellar growth of quiescent bulges in star-forming galaxies, which mostly happens over the same redshift range. Within the main sequence, we measure a nonvarying SFR dispersion of 0.3 dex: at a fixed redshift and stellar mass, about 68\% of star-forming galaxies form stars at a universal rate within a factor 2. The specific SFR (sSFR = SFR/M{\textless}SUB{\textgreater}∗{\textless}/SUB{\textgreater}) of star-forming galaxies is found to continuously increase from z = 0 to 4. Finally we discuss the implications of our findings on the cosmic SFR history and on the origin of present-day stars: more than two-thirds of present-day stars must have formed in a regime dominated by the "main sequence" mode. As a consequence we conclude that, although omnipresent in the distant Universe, galaxy mergers had little impact in shaping the global star formation history over the last 12.5 billion years. {\textless}P /{\textgreater}Herschel is an ESA space observatory with science instruments provided by European-led Principal Investigator consortia and with important participation from NASA.Appendices are available in electronic form at {\textless}A href="http://www.aanda.org/10.1051/0004-6361/201425017/olm"{\textgreater}http://www.aanda.org{\textless}/A{\textgreater}},

We show and employ our extensive spectroscopic data set taken with the VIsible Multi-Object Spectrograph instrument as part of our CLASH-VLT program, to confirm spectroscopically 10 strong lensing systems and to select a sample of 175 plausible cluster members to a limiting stellar mass of log (M */M ⊙) {\textasciitilde}= 8.6. We reproduce the measured positions of a set of 30 multiple images with a remarkable median offset of only 0.''3 by means of a comprehensive strong lensing model comprised of two cluster dark-matter halos, represented by cored elliptical pseudo-isothermal mass distributions, and the cluster member components, parameterized with dual pseudo-isothermal total mass profiles. The latter have total mass-to-light ratios increasing with the galaxy HST/WFC3 near-IR (F160W) luminosities. The measurement of the total enclosed mass within the Einstein radius is accurate to {\textasciitilde}5\%, including the systematic uncertainties estimated from six distinct mass models. We emphasize that the use of multiple-image systems with spectroscopic redshifts and knowledge of cluster membership based on extensive spectroscopic information is key to constructing robust high-resolution mass maps. We also produce magnification maps over the central area that is covered with HST observations. We investigate the galaxy contribution, both in terms of total and stellar mass, to the total mass budget of the cluster. When compared with the outcomes of cosmological N-body simulations, our results point to a lack of massive subhalos in the inner regions of simulated clusters with total masses similar to that of MACS J0416.1-2403. Our findings of the location and shape of the cluster dark-matter halo density profiles and on the cluster substructures provide intriguing tests of the assumed collisionless, cold nature of dark matter and of the role played by baryons in the process of structure formation.

	abstract = {Distant star-forming galaxies show a correlation between their star formation rates (SFRs) and stellar masses, and this has deep implications for galaxy formation. Here, we present a study on the evolution of the slope and scatter of the SFR-stellar mass relation for galaxies at 3.5 {\textless}= z {\textless}= 6.5 using multi-wavelength photometry in GOODS-S from the Cosmic Assembly Near-infrared Deep Extragalactic Legacy Survey (CANDELS) and Spitzer Extended Deep Survey. We describe an updated, Bayesian spectral-energy distribution fitting method that incorporates effects of nebular line emission, star formation histories that are constant or rising with time, and different dust-attenuation prescriptions (starburst and Small Magellanic Cloud). From z = 6.5 to z = 3.5 star-forming galaxies in CANDELS follow a nearly unevolving correlation between stellar mass and SFR that follows SFR {\textasciitilde} M\_{\textbackslash}star {\textasciicircum}a with a =0.54 ± 0.16 at z {\textasciitilde} 6 and 0.70 ± 0.21 at z {\textasciitilde} 4. This evolution requires a star formation history that increases with decreasing redshift (on average, the SFRs of individual galaxies rise with time). The observed scatter in the SFR-stellar mass relation is tight, σ(log SFR/M ⊙ yr-1) {\textless} 0.3-0.4 dex, for galaxies with log M sstarf/M ⊙ {\textgreater} 9 dex. Assuming that the SFR is tied to the net gas inflow rate (SFR {\textasciitilde} {\textbackslash}dot\{M\}gas), then the scatter in the gas inflow rate is also smaller than 0.3-0.4 dex for star-forming galaxies in these stellar mass and redshift ranges, at least when averaged over the timescale of star formation. We further show that the implied star formation history of objects selected on the basis of their co-moving number densities is consistent with the evolution in the SFR-stellar mass relation.},

	abstract = {We present strong-lensing models as well as mass and magnification maps for the cores of the six Hubble Space Telescope (HST) Frontier Fields galaxy clusters. Our parametric lens models are constrained by the locations and redshifts of multiple image systems of lensed background galaxies. We use a combination of photometric redshifts and spectroscopic redshifts of the lensed background sources obtained by us (for A2744 and AS1063), collected from the literature, or kindly provided by the lensing community. Using our results, we (1) compare the derived mass distribution of each cluster to its light distribution, (2) quantify the cumulative magnification power of the HST Frontier Fields clusters, (3) describe how our models can be used to estimate the magnification and image multiplicity of lensed background sources at all redshifts and at any position within the cluster cores, and (4) discuss systematic effects and caveats resulting from our modeling methods. We specifically investigate the effect of the use of spectroscopic and photometric redshift constraints on the uncertainties of the resulting models. We find that the photometric redshift estimates of lensed galaxies are generally in excellent agreement with spectroscopic redshifts, where available. However, the flexibility associated with relaxed redshift priors may cause the complexity of large-scale structure that is needed to account for the lensing signal to be underestimated. Our findings thus underline the importance of spectroscopic arc redshifts, or tight photometric redshift constraints, for high precision lens models. All products from our best-fit lens models (magnification, convergence, shear, deflection field) and model simulations for estimating errors are made available via the Mikulski Archive for Space Telescopes.

Here, we present models of the mass distribution in the six HFF cluster lenses, derived from a joint strong- and weak-lensing analysis anchored by a total of 88 multiple-image systems identified in existing HST data. The resulting maps of the projected mass distribution and of the gravitational magnification effectively calibrate the HFF clusters as gravitational telescopes. Allowing the computation of search areas in the source plane, these maps are provided to the community to facilitate the exploitation of forthcoming HFF data for quantitative studies of the gravitationally lensed population of background galaxies. Our models of the gravitational magnification afforded by the HFF clusters allow us to quantify the lensing-induced boost in sensitivity over blank-field observations and predict that galaxies at z {\textgreater} 10 and as faint as m(AB) = 32 will be detectable, up to 2 mag fainter than the limit of the Hubble Ultra Deep Field.},

Taking advantage of the unprecedented depth provided by HST/Advanced Camera for Survey observations in three passbands, we identify 51 new multiply imaged galaxies, quadrupling the previous census and bringing the grand total to 68, comprising 194 individual lensed images. Having selected a subset of the 57 most securely identified multiply imaged galaxies, we use the LENSTOOL software package to constrain a lens model comprised of two cluster-scale dark-matter haloes and 98 galaxy-scale haloes. Our best-fitting model predicts image positions with an rms error of 0.68 arcsec, which constitutes an improvement of almost a factor of 2 over previous, pre-HFF models of this cluster. We find the total projected mass inside a 200 kpc aperture to be (1.60 ± 0.01) × 1014 M⊙, a measurement that offers a three-fold improvement in precision, reaching the per cent level for the first time in any cluster. Finally, we quantify the increase in precision of the derived gravitational magnification of high-redshift galaxies and find an improvement by a factor of ∼2.5 in the statistical uncertainty. Our findings impressively confirm that HFF imaging has indeed opened the domain of high-precision mass measurements for massive clusters of galaxies.},

First, we derive the distribution function of intergalactic absorbers from the latest observational statistics of the Lyα forest, Lyman-limit systems and damped Lyα systems. The distribution function reproduces the observed redshift evolution of the Lyα depression and the mean-free path of the Lyman continuum excellently and simultaneously. We then derive a set of analytic functions describing the mean intergalactic attenuation curve for objects at z {\textgreater} 0.5. The new model predicts less (or more) Lyα attenuation for z ≃ 3-5 (z {\textgreater} 6) sources through the usual broad-band filters relative to the original Madau model. This may cause a systematic difference in the photometric redshift estimates, which is, however, still small: about 0.05. Finally, we find a more than 0.5 mag overestimation of Lyman-continuum attenuation in the original Madau model at z {\textgreater} 3, which causes a significant overcorrection against direct observations of the Lyman continuum of galaxies.},

We find that the strong correlation between stellar mass and star formation rate seen at lower redshift (the "main sequence" of star-forming galaxies) extends to z {\textasciitilde} 6. The observed relation and scatter is consistent with a continued increase in star formation rate at fixed mass in line with extrapolations from lower-redshift observations. It is difficult to explain this continued correlation, especially for the most massive systems, unless the most massive galaxies are forming stars near their Eddington-limited rate from their first collapse. Furthermore, we find no evidence for moderate quenching at higher masses, indicating quenching either has not occurred prior to z {\textasciitilde} 6 or else occurs rapidly, so that few galaxies are visible in transition between star-forming and quenched.},

The catalog is based on source detection in the WFC3 F160W band. The F160W mosaic includes the data from CANDELS deep and wide observations as well as previous ERS and HUDF09 programs. The mosaic reaches a 5σ limiting depth (within an aperture of radius 0.''17) of 27.4, 28.2, and 29.7 AB for CANDELS wide, deep, and HUDF regions, respectively. The catalog contains 34,930 sources with the representative 50\% completeness reaching 25.9, 26.6, and 28.1 AB in the F160W band for the three regions. In addition to WFC3 bands, the catalog also includes data from UV (U band from both CTIO/MOSAIC and VLT/VIMOS), optical (HST/ACS F435W, F606W, F775W, F814W, and F850LP), and infrared (HST/WFC3 F098M, VLT/ISAAC Ks, VLT/HAWK-I Ks, and Spitzer/IRAC 3.6, 4.5, 5.8, 8.0 μm) observations. The catalog is validated via stellar colors, comparison with other published catalogs, zero-point offsets determined from the best-fit templates of the spectral energy distribution of spectroscopically observed objects, and the accuracy of photometric redshifts. The catalog is able to detect unreddened star-forming (passive) galaxies with stellar mass of 1010 M ⊙ at a 50\% completeness level to z {\textasciitilde} 3.4 (2.8), 4.6 (3.2), and 7.0 (4.2) in the three regions. As an example of application, the catalog is used to select both star-forming and passive galaxies at z {\textasciitilde} 2-4 via the Balmer break.

The PSF-matched catalog is generated using position-dependent PSFs ensuring accurate colors across the entire field. Also included is a catalog of photometric redshifts (z phot) for all galaxies computed with the EAZY code. Comparison with spectroscopy from the zCOSMOS 10k bright sample shows that up to z {\textasciitilde} 1.5 the z phot are accurate to Δz/(1 + z) = 0.013, with a catastrophic outlier fraction of only 1.6\%. The z phot also show good agreement with the z phot from the NEWFIRM Medium Band Survey out to z {\textasciitilde} 3. A catalog of stellar masses and stellar population parameters for galaxies determined using the FAST spectral energy distribution fitting code is provided for all galaxies. Also included are rest-frame U - V and V - J colors, L 2800 and L IR. The UVJ color-color diagram confirms that the galaxy bi-modality is well-established out to z {\textasciitilde} 2. Star-forming galaxies also obey a star-forming "main sequence" out to z {\textasciitilde} 2.5, and this sequence evolves in a manner consistent with previous measurements. The COSMOS/UltraVISTA Ks -selected catalog covers a unique parameter space in both depth, area, and multi-wavelength coverage and promises to be a useful tool for studying the growth of the galaxy population out to z {\textasciitilde} 3-4. .},

After first summarizing progress with the seven different techniques which have been used to date in the discovery of objects at z {\textgreater} 5, I focus thereafter on the two selection methods which have yielded substantial samples of galaxies at early times, namely Lyman-break and Lyman-α selection. I discuss a decade of progress in galaxy sample selection at z ∼eq 5 - 8 , including issues of completeness and contamination, and address some of the confusion which has been created by erroneous reports of extreme-redshift objects. Next I provide an overview of our current knowledge of the evolving ultraviolet continuum and Lyman-α galaxy luminosity functions at z ∼eq 5 - 8 , and discuss what can be learned from exploring the relationship between the Lyman-break and Lyman-α selected populations. I then summarize what is known about the physical properties of these galaxies in the young universe, before considering the wider implications of this work for the cosmic history of star formation, and for the reionization of the universe. I conclude with a brief summary of the exciting prospects for further progress in this field in the next 5-10 years. Throughout, key concepts such as selection techniques and luminosity functions are explained assuming essentially no prior knowledge. The intention is that this chapter can be used as an introduction to the observational study of high-redshift galaxies, as well as providing a review of the latest results in this fast-moving research field up to the end of 2011.},

We find a significant nonlinear slope of the relation, SFRvpropM 0.6 sstarf, and a constant observed scatter of 0.34 dex, independent of redshift and M sstarf. However, if we select only blue galaxies we find a linear relation SFRvpropM sstarf, similar to previous results at z = 0 by Peng et al. This selection excludes red, dusty, star-forming galaxies with higher masses, which brings down the slope. By selecting on L IR/L UV (a proxy for dust obscuration) and the rest-frame U - V colors, we show that star-forming galaxies fall in three distinct regions of the log(SFR)-log(M sstarf) plane: (1) actively star-forming galaxies with "normal" dust obscuration and associated colors (54\% for log (M sstarf) {\textgreater} 10 at 1 {\textless} z {\textless} 1.5), (2) red star-forming galaxies with low levels of dust obscuration and low-specific SFRs (11\%), and (3) dusty, blue star-forming galaxies with high-specific SFRs (7\%). The remaining 28\% comprises quiescent galaxies. Galaxies on the "normal" star formation sequence show strong trends of increasing dust attenuation with stellar mass and a decreasing specific SFR, with an observed scatter of 0.25 dex. The dusty, blue galaxies reside in the upper envelope of the star formation sequence with remarkably similar spectral shapes at all masses, suggesting that the same physical process is dominating the stellar light. The red, low-dust star-forming galaxies may be in the process of shutting off and migrating to the quiescent population.},

	abstract = {To automate source detection, two-dimensional light profile Sérsic modelling and catalogue compilation in large survey applications, we introduce a new code Galaxy Analysis over Large Areas: Parameter Assessment by GALFITting Objects from SEXTRACTOR (GALAPAGOS). Based on a single set-up, GALAPAGOS can process a complete set of survey images. It detects sources in the data, estimates a local sky background, cuts postage stamp images for all sources, prepares object masks, performs Sérsic fitting including neighbours and compiles all objects in a final output catalogue. For the initial source detection, GALAPAGOS applies SEXTRACTOR, while GALFIT is incorporated for modelling Sérsic profiles. It measures the background sky involved in the Sérsic fitting by means of a flux growth curve. GALAPAGOS determines postage stamp sizes based on SEXTRACTOR shape parameters. In order to obtain precise model parameters, GALAPAGOS incorporates a complex sorting mechanism and makes use of modern CPU's multiplexing capabilities. It combines SEXTRACTOR and GALFIT data in a single output table. When incorporating information from overlapping tiles, GALAPAGOS automatically removes multiple entries from identical sources. GALAPAGOS is programmed in the Interactive Data Language (IDL). We test the stability and the ability to properly recover structural parameters extensively with artificial image simulations. Moreover, we apply GALAPAGOS successfully to the STAGES data set. For one-orbit Hubble Space Telescope data, a single 2.2-GHz CPU processes about 1000 primary sources per 24 h. Note that GALAPAGOS results depend critically on the user-defined parameter set-up. This paper provides useful guidelines to help the user make sensible choices.},

	abstract = {Context. Study of the dust extinction in high-redshift galaxies is fundamental to obtaining an estimate of the corrected star formation rate density (SFRD) and to put constraints on galaxy evolution models. {\textless}BR /{\textgreater} Aims: We plan to analyse dust extinction in Lyman break galaxies (LBGs) by introducing a new and more reliable approach to their selection and to the characterization of their distribution of UV slopes β, using deep IR images from HST. We fully discuss the methodology and the results, focusing on a robust sample of z {\textasciitilde} 4 LBGs. {\textless}BR /{\textgreater} Methods: We exploit deep WFC3 IR observations of the ERS and HUDF fields over GOODS-South, combined with HST-ACS optical data, to select z {\textasciitilde} 4 LBGs through a new (B - V) vs. (V - H) colour diagram. The UV slope of the selected galaxies is robustly determined by a linear fit over their observed I,Z,Y,J magnitudes, coherently with the original definition of β. The same fit is used to determine their rest-frame UV magnitudes M{\textless}SUB{\textgreater}1600{\textless}/SUB{\textgreater} through a simple interpolation. We estimate the effect of observational uncertainties with detailed simulations that we also exploit, under a parametric maximum-likelihood approach, to constrain the probability density function of UV slopes PDF(β) as a function of rest-frame magnitude. {\textless}BR /{\textgreater} Results: We find 142 robust LBGs in the ERS and 25 in the HUDF field, limiting our sample to S/N(H) \&gt; 10 objects. Our newly defined criteria improve the selection of z {\textasciitilde} 4 LBGs and allow us to exclude red interlopers at lower redshifts, especially z {\textasciitilde} 3-3.5 objects. We show that using a linear fit to estimate β and accurately characterizing observational effects are required in this kind of analysis of flux-limited samples. We find that z {\textasciitilde} 4 LBGs are characterized by blue UV slopes, suggesting a low dust extinction: all L \&lt; L{\textless}SUP{\textgreater}∗{\textless}/SUP{\textgreater} galaxies have an average UV slope ⟨β⟩ ≃ -2.1, while brighter objects are only slightly redder (⟨β⟩ ≃ -1.9). We find an intrinsic dispersion ≃0.3 for PDF(β) at all magnitudes. The SFRD at z {\textasciitilde} 4 corrected according to these estimates turns out to be lower than previously found: log(SFRD) ≃ -1.09 M{\textless}SUB{\textgreater}⊙{\textless}/SUB{\textgreater}/yr/Mpc{\textless}SUP{\textgreater}3{\textless}/SUP{\textgreater}. Finally, we discuss how the UV slope of z {\textasciitilde} 4 galaxies changes as a function of the dust-corrected UV magnitude (i.e. SFR). We show that most galaxies with high SFR (≳80 M{\textless}SUB{\textgreater}⊙{\textless}/SUB{\textgreater}/yr) are highly extincted objects. Among galaxies with lower SFR, we detect many with a much lower amount of reddening, although current observational limits prevent us from detecting those with high extinction, if they exist.},

	abstract = {The final product of galaxy evolution through cosmic time is the population of galaxies in the local universe. These galaxies are also those that can be studied in most detail, thus providing a stringent benchmark for our understanding of galaxy evolution. Through the huge success of spectroscopic single-fiber, statistical surveys of the Local Universe in the last decade, it has become clear, however, that an authoritative observational description of galaxies will involve measuring their spatially resolved properties over their full optical extent for a statistically significant sample. We present here the Calar Alto Legacy Integral Field Area (CALIFA) survey, which has been designed to provide a first step in this direction. We summarize the survey goals and design, including sample selection and observational strategy. We also showcase the data taken during the first observing runs (June/July 2010) and outline the reduction pipeline, quality control schemes and general characteristics of the reduced data. This survey is obtaining spatially resolved spectroscopic information of a diameter selected sample of {\textasciitilde}600 galaxies in the Local Universe (0.005 \&lt; z \&lt; 0.03). CALIFA has been designed to allow the building of two-dimensional maps of the following quantities: (a) stellar populations: ages and metallicities; (b) ionized gas: distribution, excitation mechanism and chemical abundances; and (c) kinematic properties: both from stellar and ionized gas components. CALIFA uses the PPAK integral field unit (IFU), with a hexagonal field-of-view of {\textasciitilde}1.3⎕', with a 100\% covering factor by adopting a three-pointing dithering scheme. The optical wavelength range is covered from 3700 to 7000 Å, using two overlapping setups (V500 and V1200), with different resolutions: R {\textasciitilde} 850 and R {\textasciitilde} 1650, respectively. CALIFA is a legacy survey, intended for the community. The reduced data will be released, once the quality has been guaranteed. The analyzed data fulfillthe expectations of the original observing proposal, on the basis of a set of quality checks and exploratory analysis: (i) the final datacubes reach a 3σ limiting surface brightness depth of {\textasciitilde}23.0 mag/arcsec{\textless}SUP{\textgreater}2{\textless}/SUP{\textgreater} for the V500 grating data ({\textasciitilde}22.8 mag/arcsec{\textless}SUP{\textgreater}2{\textless}/SUP{\textgreater} for V1200); (ii) about {\textasciitilde}70\% of the covered field-of-view is above this 3σ limit; (iii) the data have a blue-to-red relative flux calibration within a few percent in most of the wavelength range; (iv) the absolute flux calibration is accurate within {\textasciitilde}8\%with respect to SDSS; (v) the measured spectral resolution is {\textasciitilde}85 km s{\textless}SUP{\textgreater}-1{\textless}/SUP{\textgreater} for V1200 ({\textasciitilde}150 km s{\textless}SUP{\textgreater}-1{\textless}/SUP{\textgreater} for V500); (vi) the estimated accuracy of the wavelength calibration is {\textasciitilde}5 km s{\textless}SUP{\textgreater}-1{\textless}/SUP{\textgreater} for the V1200 data ({\textasciitilde}10 km s{\textless}SUP{\textgreater}-1{\textless}/SUP{\textgreater} for the V500 data); (vii) the aperture matched CALIFA and SDSS spectra are qualitatively and quantitatively similar. Finally, we show that we are able to carry out all measurements indicated above, recovering the properties of the stellar populations, the ionized gas andthe kinematics of both components. The associated maps illustrate the spatial variation of these parameters across the field, reemphasizing the redshift dependence of single aperture spectroscopic measurements. We conclude from this first look at the data that CALIFA will be an important resource for archaeological studies of galaxies in the Local Universe. {\textless}P /{\textgreater}Based on observations collected at the Centro Astronómico Hispano Alemán (CAHA) at Calar Alto, operated jointly by the Max-Planck-Institut für Astronomie and the Instituto de Astrofísica de Andalucía (CSIC).},

	abstract = {We present a two-dimensional (2D) fitting algorithm (GALFIT, ver. 3) with new capabilities to study the structural components of galaxies and other astronomical objects in digital images. Our technique improves on previous 2D fitting algorithms by allowing for irregular, curved, logarithmic and power-law spirals, ring, and truncated shapes in otherwise traditional parametric functions like the Sérsic, Moffat, King, Ferrer, etc., profiles. One can mix and match these new shape features freely, with or without constraints, and apply them to an arbitrary number of model components of numerous profile types, so as to produce realistic-looking galaxy model images. Yet, despite the potential for extreme complexity, the meaning of the key parameters like the Sérsic index, effective radius, or luminosity remains intuitive and essentially unchanged. The new features have an interesting potential for use to quantify the degree of asymmetry of galaxies, to quantify low surface brightness tidal features beneath and beyond luminous galaxies, to allow more realistic decompositions of galaxy subcomponents in the presence of strong rings and spiral arms, and to enable ways to gauge the uncertainties when decomposing galaxy subcomponents. We illustrate these new features by way of several case studies that display various levels of complexity.},

This Bayesian inference tool calculates the evidence, with an associated error estimate, and produces posterior samples from distributions that may contain multiple modes and pronounced (curving) degeneracies in high dimensions.

The accuracy and economy of the MULTINEST algorithm are demonstrated by application to two toy problems and to a cosmological inference problem focusing on the extension of the vanilla Λ cold dark matter model to include spatial curvature and a varying equation of state for dark energy. The MULTINEST software, which is fully parallelized using MPI and includes an interface to COSMOMC, is available at http://www.mrao.cam.ac.uk/software/multinest/.

These are found with a model that assumes mass approximately traces light, with a low-order expansion to allow for flexibility on large scales. The model is constrained initially by the well-known five-image system (z = 1.675) and refined as new multiply-lensed systems are identified using the model. Photometric redshifts of these new systems are then used to constrain better the mass profile by adopting the standard cosmological relation between redshift and lensing distance. Our model requires only six free parameters to describe well all positional and redshift data. The resulting inner mass profile has a slope of d logM/d logr {\textasciitilde}= -0.55, consistent with new weak-lensing measurements where the data overlap, at r {\textasciitilde}= 200 kpc/h70. The combined profile is well fitted by a high-concentration Navarro, Frenk \& White (NFW) mass profile, Cvir {\textasciitilde} 8.6 +/- 1.6, similar to other well-studied clusters, but larger than predicted with standard Λ cold dark matter (ΛCDM). A well-defined radial critical curve is generated by the model and is clearly observed at r {\textasciitilde}= 12 arcsec, outlined by elongated images pointing towards the centre of mass. The relative fluxes of the multiply-lensed images are found to agree well with the modelled magnifications, providing an independent consistency check.},

Accurate galaxy densities are measured thanks to the large sample of 1200 spectroscopic redshifts with high ( 70\%) spectroscopic completeness. Morphology and stellar masses are derived from deep HST-ACS imaging, supplemented by ground based imaging programs and photometry from the IRAC camera onboard \{Spitzer\}. {\textless}BR /{\textgreater}Results: We show that the star formation-density relation observed locally was reversed at z∼ 1: the average SFR of an individual galaxy increased with local galaxy density when the universe was less than half its present age. Hierarchical galaxy formation models (simulated lightcones from the Millennium model) predicted such a reversal to occur only at earlier epochs (z\&gt;2) and at a lower level. We present a remarkable structure at z∼ 1.016, containing X-ray traced galaxy concentrations, which will eventually merge into a Virgo-like cluster. This structure illustrates how the individual SFR of galaxies increases with density and shows that it is the 1-2 Mpc scale that affects most the star formation in galaxies at z∼1. The SFR of z∼1 galaxies is found to correlate with stellar mass suggesting that mass plays a role in the observed star formation-density trend. However the specific SFR (=SFR/M{\textless}SUB{\textgreater}star{\textless}/SUB{\textgreater}) decreases with stellar mass while it increases with galaxy density, which implies that the environment does directly affect the star formation activity of galaxies. Major mergers do not appear to be the unique or even major cause for this effect since nearly half (46\%) of the luminous infrared galaxies (LIRGs) at z∼ 1 present the HST-ACS morphology of spirals, while only a third present a clear signature of major mergers. The remaining galaxies are divided into compact (9\%) and irregular (14\%) galaxies. Moreover, the specific SFR of major mergers is only marginally stronger than that of spirals. {\textless}BR /{\textgreater}Conclusions: These findings constrain the influence of the growth of large-scale structures on the star formation history of galaxies.

	abstract = {We present a comprehensive study of the physical properties of ∼ 105 galaxies with measurable star formation in the Sloan Digital Sky Survey (SDSS). By comparing physical information extracted from the emission lines with continuum properties, we build up a picture of the nature of star-forming galaxies at z {\textless} 0.2. We develop a method for aperture correction using resolved imaging and show that our method takes out essentially all aperture bias in the star formation rate (SFR) estimates, allowing an accurate estimate of the total SFRs in galaxies. We determine the SFR density to be 1.915+0.02-0.01 (random)+0.14-0.42 (systematic) h7010-2 M⊙ yr-1 Mpc-3 at z= 0.1 (for a Kroupa initial mass function) and we study the distribution of star formation as a function of various physical parameters. The majority of the star formation in the low-redshift Universe takes place in moderately massive galaxies (1010-1011 M⊙), typically in high surface brightness disc galaxies. Roughly 15 per cent of all star formation takes place in galaxies that show some sign of an active nucleus. About 20 per cent occurs in starburst galaxies. By focusing on the SFR per unit mass we show that the present to past average SFR, the Scalo b-parameter, is almost constant over almost three orders of magnitude in mass, declining only at M* {\textgreater} 1010 M⊙. The volume averaged b parameter is 0.408+0.005-0.002 (random)+0.029-0.090 (systematic)h-170. We use this value to constrain the star formation history of the Universe. For the concordance cosmology the present-day Universe is forming stars at at least 1/3 of its past average rate. For an exponentially declining cosmic star formation history this corresponds to a time-scale of 7+0.7-1.5 Gyr. In agreement with other work we find a correlation between b and morphological type, as well as a tight correlation between the 4000-Å break (D4000) and b. We discuss how D4000 can be used to estimate b parameters for high-redshift galaxies.},

Once the domain of astronomers concerned chiefly with stars and nearby galaxies, this field has now become a key component of observational cosmology, as technological advances have made it possible to measure the abundances of several chemical elements in a variety of environments at redshifts up to z {\textasciitilde}= 4, when the universe was in its infancy. In this series of lectures I summarise current knowledge on the chemical make-up of distant galaxies observed directly in their starlight, and of interstellar and intergalactic gas seen in absorption against the spectra of bright background sources. The picture which is emerging is one where the universe at z = 3 already included many of the constituents of today's galaxies - even at these early times we see evidence for Population I and II stars, while the "smoking gun" for Population III objects may be hidden in the chemical composition of the lowest density regions of the intergalactic medium, yet to be deciphered.},

The survey covers roughly 320 arcmin2 in the ACS F435W, F606W, F814W, and F850LP bands, divided into two well-studied fields. Existing deep observations from the Chandra X-Ray Observatory and ground-based facilities are supplemented with new, deep imaging in the optical and near-infrared from the European Southern Observatory and from the Kitt Peak National Observatory. Deep observations with the Space Infrared Telescope Facility are scheduled. Reduced data from all facilities are being released worldwide within 3-6 months of acquisition. Together, this data set provides two deep reference fields for studies of distant normal and active galaxies, supernovae, and faint stars in our own Galaxy. This Letter serves to outline the survey strategy and describe the specific data that have been used in the accompanying letters, summarizing the reduction procedures and sensitivity limits.

These predictions are based on a newly available library of observed stellar spectra. We also compute the spectral evolution across a larger wavelength range, from 91 Å to 160 μm, at lower resolution. The model incorporates recent progress in stellar evolution theory and an observationally motivated prescription for thermally pulsing stars on the asymptotic giant branch. The latter is supported by observations of surface brightness fluctuations in nearby stellar populations. We show that this model reproduces well the observed optical and near-infrared colour-magnitude diagrams of Galactic star clusters of various ages and metallicities. Stochastic fluctuations in the numbers of stars in different evolutionary phases can account for the full range of observed integrated colours of star clusters in the Magellanic Clouds. The model reproduces in detail typical galaxy spectra from the Early Data Release (EDR) of the Sloan Digital Sky Survey (SDSS). We exemplify how this type of spectral fit can constrain physical parameters such as the star formation history, metallicity and dust content of galaxies. Our model is the first to enable accurate studies of absorption-line strengths in galaxies containing stars over the full range of ages. Using the highest-quality spectra of the SDSS EDR, we show that this model can reproduce simultaneously the observed strengths of those Lick indices that do not depend strongly on element abundance ratios. The interpretation of such indices with our model should be particularly useful for constraining the star formation histories and metallicities of galaxies.},

	abstract = {We review recent determinations of the present-day mass function (PDMF) and initial mass function (IMF) in various components of the Galaxy-disk, spheroid, young, and globular clusters-and in conditions characteristic of early star formation. As a general feature, the IMF is found to depend weakly on the environment and to be well described by a power-law form for m{\textgreater}{\textasciitilde}1 Msolar and a lognormal form below, except possibly for early star formation conditions. The disk IMF for single objects has a characteristic mass around mc{\textasciitilde}0.08 Msolar and a variance in logarithmic mass σ{\textasciitilde}0.7, whereas the IMF for multiple systems has mc{\textasciitilde}0.2 Msolar and σ{\textasciitilde}0.6. The extension of the single MF into the brown dwarf regime is in good agreement with present estimates of L- and T-dwarf densities and yields a disk brown dwarf number density comparable to the stellar one, nBD{\textasciitilde}n*{\textasciitilde}0.1 pc-3. The IMF of young clusters is found to be consistent with the disk field IMF, providing the same correction for unresolved binaries, confirming the fact that young star clusters and disk field stars represent the same stellar population. Dynamical effects, yielding depletion of the lowest mass objects, are found to become consequential for ages {\textgreater}{\textasciitilde}130 Myr. The spheroid IMF relies on much less robust grounds. The large metallicity spread in the local subdwarf photometric sample, in particular, remains puzzling. Recent observations suggest that there is a continuous kinematic shear between the thick-disk population, present in local samples, and the genuine spheroid one. This enables us to derive only an upper limit for the spheroid mass density and IMF. Within all the uncertainties, the latter is found to be similar to the one derived for globular clusters and is well represented also by a lognormal form with a characteristic mass slightly larger than for the disk, mc{\textasciitilde}0.2-0.3 Msolar, excluding a significant population of brown dwarfs in globular clusters and in the spheroid. The IMF characteristic of early star formation at large redshift remains undetermined, but different observational constraints suggest that it does not extend below {\textasciitilde}1 Msolar. These results suggest a characteristic mass for star formation that decreases with time, from conditions prevailing at large redshift to conditions characteristic of the spheroid (or thick disk) to present-day conditions. These conclusions, however, remain speculative, given the large uncertainties in the spheroid and early star IMF determinations. These IMFs allow a reasonably robust determination of the Galactic present-day and initial stellar and brown dwarf contents. They also have important galactic implications beyond the Milky Way in yielding more accurate mass-to-light ratio determinations. The mass-to-light ratios obtained with the disk and the spheroid IMF yield values 1.8-1.4 times smaller than for a Salpeter IMF, respectively, in agreement with various recent dynamical determinations. This general IMF determination is examined in the context of star formation theory. None of the theories based on a Jeans-type mechanism, where fragmentation is due only to gravity, can fulfill all the observational constraints on star formation and predict a large number of substellar objects. On the other hand, recent numerical simulations of compressible turbulence, in particular in super-Alfvénic conditions, seem to reproduce both qualitatively and quantitatively the stellar and substellar IMF and thus provide an appealing theoretical foundation. In this picture, star formation is induced by the dissipation of large-scale turbulence to smaller scales through radiative MHD shocks, producing filamentary structures. These shocks produce local nonequilibrium structures with large density contrasts, which collapse eventually in gravitationally bound objects under the combined influence of turbulence and gravity. The concept of a single Jeans mass is replaced by a distribution of local Jeans masses, representative of the lognormal probability density function of the turbulent gas. Objects below the mean thermal Jeans mass still have a possibility to collapse, although with a decreasing probability.

	abstract = {We present a two-dimensional fitting algorithm (GALFIT) designed to extract structural components from galaxy images, with emphasis on closely modeling light profiles of spatially well-resolved, nearby galaxies observed with the Hubble Space Telescope. Our algorithm improves on previous techniques in two areas: by being able to simultaneously fit a galaxy with an arbitrary number of components and with optimization in computation speed, suited for working on large galaxy images. We use two-dimensional models such as the ``Nuker'' law, the Sérsic (de Vaucouleurs) profile, an exponential disk, and Gaussian or Moffat functions. The azimuthal shapes are generalized ellipses that can fit disky and boxy components. Some potential applications of our program include: standard modeling of global galaxy profiles; extracting bars, stellar disks, double nuclei, and compact nuclear sources; and measuring absolute dust extinction or surface brightness fluctuations after removing the galaxy model. When examined in detail, we find that even simple looking galaxies generally require at least three components to be modeled accurately, rather than the one or two components more often employed. Many galaxies with complex isophotes, ellipticity changes, and position angle twists can be modeled accurately in two dimensions. We illustrate this by way of 11 case studies, which include regular and barred spiral galaxies, highly disky lenticular galaxies, and elliptical galaxies displaying various levels of complexities. A useful extension of this algorithm is to accurately extract nuclear point sources in galaxies. We compare two-dimensional and one-dimensional extraction techniques on simulated images of galaxies having nuclear slopes with different degrees of cuspiness, and we then illustrate the application of the program to several examples of nearby galaxies with weak nuclei.

	abstract = {A universal initial mass function (IMF) is not intuitive, but so far no convincing evidence for a variable IMF exists. The detection of systematic variations of the IMF with star-forming conditions would be the Rosetta Stone for star formation. In this contribution an average or Galactic-field IMF is defined, stressing that there is evidence for a change in the power-law index at only two masses: near 0.5Msolar and near 0.08Msolar. Using this supposed universal IMF, the uncertainty inherent in any observational estimate of the IMF is investigated by studying the scatter introduced by Poisson noise and the dynamical evolution of star clusters. It is found that this apparent scatter reproduces quite well the observed scatter in power-law index determinations, thus defining the fundamental limit within which any true variation becomes undetectable. The absence of evidence for a variable IMF means that any true variation of the IMF in well-studied populations must be smaller than this scatter. Determinations of the power-law indices α are subject to systematic errors arising mostly from unresolved binaries. The systematic bias is quantified here, with the result that the single-star IMFs for young star clusters are systematically steeper by Δα{\textasciitilde}0.5 between 0.1 and 1Msolar than the Galactic-field IMF, which is populated by, on average, about 5-Gyr-old stars. The MFs in globular clusters appear to be, on average, systematically flatter than the Galactic-field IMF (Piotto \& Zoccali; Paresce \& De Marchi), and the recent detection of ancient white-dwarf candidates in the Galactic halo and the absence of associated low-mass stars (Ibata et al.; Méndez \& Minniti) suggest a radically different IMF for this ancient population. Star formation in higher metallicity environments thus appears to produce relatively more low-mass stars. While still tentative, this is an interesting trend, being consistent with a systematic variation of the IMF as expected from theoretical arguments.},

	abstract = {We present a new model for computing the effects of dust on the integrated spectral properties of galaxies, based on an idealized description of the main features of the interstellar medium (ISM). The model includes the ionization of H II regions in the interiors of the dense clouds in which stars form and the influence of the finite lifetime of these clouds on the absorption of radiation. We compute the production of emission lines and the absorption of continuum radiation in the H II regions and the subsequent transfer of line and continuum radiation in the surrounding H I regions and the ambient ISM. This enables us to interpret simultaneously all the observations of an ultraviolet-selected sample of nearby starburst galaxies, including the ratio of far-infrared to ultraviolet luminosities, the ratio of Hα to Hβ luminosities, the Hα equivalent width, and the ultraviolet spectral slope. We show that the finite lifetime of stellar birth clouds is a key ingredient for resolving an apparent discrepancy between the attenuation of line and continuum photons in starburst galaxies. In addition, we find that an effective absorption curve proportional to λ-0.7 reproduces the observed relation between the ratio of far-infrared to ultraviolet luminosities and the ultraviolet spectral slope. We interpret this relation most simply as a sequence in the overall dust content of the galaxies. The shallow wavelength dependence of the effective absorption curve is compatible with the steepness of known extinction curves if the dust has a patchy distribution. In particular, we find that a random distribution of discrete clouds with optical depths similar to those in the Milky Way provides a consistent interpretation of all the observations. A noteworthy outcome of our detailed analysis is that the observed mean relations for starburst galaxies can be closely approximated by the following simple recipe: use an effective absorption curve proportional to λ-0.7 to attenuate the line and continuum radiation from each stellar generation, and lower the normalization of the curve, typically by a factor of 3 after 107 yr, to account for the dispersal of the birth clouds. This recipe or our full model for absorption can be incorporated easily into any population synthesis model.},

	abstract = {We refine a technique to measure the absorption-corrected ultraviolet (UV) luminosity of starburst galaxies using rest-frame UV quantities alone and apply it to Lyman-limit U dropouts at z{\textasciitilde}3 found in the Hubble Deep Field (HDF). The method is based on an observed correlation between the ratio of far-infrared (FIR) to UV fluxes with spectral slope β (a UV color). A simple fit to this relation allows the UV flux absorbed by dust and reprocessed to the FIR to be calculated, and hence the dust-free UV luminosity to be determined. International Ultraviolet Explorer spectra and Infrared Astronomical Satellite fluxes of local starbursts are used to calibrate the FFIR/F1600 versus β relation in terms of A1600 (the dust absorption at 1600 Å) and the transformation from broadband photometric color to β. Both calibrations are almost completely independent of theoretical stellar-population models. We show that the recent marginal and nondetections of HDF U dropouts at radio and submillimeter wavelengths are consistent with their assumed starburst nature and our calculated A1600. This is also true of recent observations of the ratio of optical emission-line flux to UV flux density in the brightest U dropouts. This latter ratio turns out not to be a good indicator of dust extinction. In U dropouts, absolute magnitude M1600,0 correlates with β: brighter galaxies are redder, as is observed to be the case for local starburst galaxies. This suggests that a mass-metallicity relationship is already in place at z{\textasciitilde}3. The absorption-corrected UV luminosity function of U dropouts extends up to M1600,0{\textasciitilde}-24 AB mag, corresponding to a star formation rate {\textasciitilde}200 {\textbackslash}Mscrsolar yr-1 (H0=50 km s-1 Mpc-3 and q0=0.5 are assumed throughout). The absorption-corrected UV luminosity density at z{\textasciitilde}3 is ρ1600,0{\textgreater}=1.4×1027 ergs-1 Hz-1 Mpc-1. It is still a lower limit since completeness corrections have not been done and because only galaxies with A1600{\textless}{\textasciitilde}3.6 mag are blue enough in the UV to be selected as U dropouts. The luminosity-weighted mean dust-absorption factor of our sample is 5.4+/-0.9 at 1600 Å.

	abstract = {We present initial results of a survey for star-forming galaxies in the redshift range 3.8{\textless}{\textasciitilde}z{\textless}{\textasciitilde}4.5. This sample consists of a photometric catalog of 244 galaxies culled from a total solid angle of 0.23 deg2 to an apparent magnitude of IAB=25.0. Spectroscopic redshifts in the range 3.61{\textless}=z{\textless}=4.81 have been obtained for 48 of these galaxies; their median redshift is =4.13. Selecting these galaxies in a manner entirely analogous to our large survey for Lyman-break galaxies at smaller redshift (2.7{\textless}{\textasciitilde}z{\textless}{\textasciitilde}3.4) allows a relatively clean differential comparison between the populations and integrated luminosity density at these two cosmic epochs. Over the same range of UV luminosity, the spectroscopic properties of the galaxy samples at z{\textasciitilde}4 and z{\textasciitilde}3 are indistinguishable, as are the luminosity function shapes and the total integrated UV luminosity densities [ρUV(z=3)/ρUV(z=4)=1.1+/-0.3]. We see no evidence at these bright magnitudes for the steep decline in the star formation density inferred from fainter photometric Lyman-break galaxies in the Hubble deep field (HDF). The HDF provides the only existing data on Lyman-break galaxy number densities at fainter magnitudes. We have reanalyzed the z{\textasciitilde}3 and z{\textasciitilde}4 Lyman-break galaxies in the HDF using our improved knowledge of the spectral energy distributions of these galaxies, and we find, like previous authors, that faint Lyman-break galaxies appear to be rarer at z{\textasciitilde}4 than z{\textasciitilde}3. This might signal a large change in the faint-end slope of the Lyman-break galaxy luminosity function between redshifts z{\textasciitilde}3 and z{\textasciitilde}4, or, more likely, be due to significant variance in the number counts within the small volumes probed by the HDF at high redshifts ({\textasciitilde}160 times smaller than the ground-based surveys discussed here). If the true luminosity density at z{\textasciitilde}4 is somewhat higher than implied by the HDF, as our ground-based sample suggests, then the emissivity of star formation as a function of redshift would appear essentially constant for all z{\textgreater}1 once internally consistent corrections for dust are made. This suggests that there may be no obvious peak in star formation activity and that the onset of substantial star formation in galaxies might occur at z{\textgreater}{\textasciitilde}4.5.

	abstract = {The Lyman decrement associated with the cumulative effect of HI in QSO absorption systems along the line of sight provides a distinctive feature for identifying galaxies at z{\textgreater}{\textasciitilde}2.5. Colour criteria, which are sensitive to the presence of a Lyman continuum break superposed on an otherwise flat UV spectrum, have been shown, through Keck spectroscopy, to successfully identify a substantial population of star-forming galaxies at 3{\textless}{\textasciitilde}z{\textless}{\textasciitilde}3.5. Such objects have proven to be surprisingly elusive in field galaxy redshift surveys; quantification of their surface densities and morphologies is crucial for determining how and when galaxies formed. The Hubble Deep Field (HDF) observations offer the opportunity to exploit the ubiquitous effect of intergalactic absorption and obtain useful statistical constraints on the redshift distribution of galaxies to considerably fainter limits than the current spectroscopic limits. We model the HI cosmic opacity as a function of redshift, including scattering in resonant lines of the Lyman series and Lyman continuum absorption, and use stellar population synthesis models with a wide variety of ages, metallicities, dust contents and redshifts to derive colour selection criteria that provide a robust separation between high-redshift and low-redshift galaxies. From the HDF images we construct a sample of star-forming galaxies at 2{\textless}{\textasciitilde}z{\textless}{\textasciitilde}4.5. While none of the {\textasciitilde}60 objects in the HDF having known Keck/Low-Resolution Imaging Spectrograph (LRIS) spectroscopic redshifts in the range 0{\textless}{\textasciitilde}z{\textless}{\textasciitilde}1.4 is found to contaminate our high-redshift sample, our colour criteria are able to efficiently select the 2.6{\textless}{\textasciitilde}z{\textless}{\textasciitilde}3.2 galaxies identified by Steidel et al. The ultraviolet (and blue) dropout technique opens up the possibility of investigating cosmic star and element formation in the early Universe. We set a lower limit to the ejection rate of heavy elements per unit comoving volume from Type II supernovae at =2.75 of {\textasciitilde}=3.6x10{\textasciicircum}-4 M\_solar yr{\textasciicircum}-1 Mpc{\textasciicircum}-3 (for q\_0=0.5 and H\_0=50 km s{\textasciicircum}-1 Mpc{\textasciicircum}-1), which is 3 times higher than the local value but still 4 times lower than the rate observed at z{\textasciitilde}=1. At =4, our lower limit to the cosmic metal ejection rate is {\textasciitilde}=3 times lower than the =2.75 value. We discuss the implications of these results on models of galaxy formation, and on the chemical enrichment and ionization history of the intergalactic medium.},

The survey, described in detail in this paper, will definitively establish the degree of concentration of dark matter in the cluster cores, a key prediction of structure formation models. The CLASH cluster sample is larger and less biased than current samples of space-based imaging studies of clusters to similar depth, as we have minimized lensing-based selection that favors systems with overly dense cores. Specifically, 20 CLASH clusters are solely X-ray selected. The X-ray-selected clusters are massive (kT {\textgreater} 5 keV) and, in most cases, dynamically relaxed. Five additional clusters are included for their lensing strength (θEin {\textgreater} 35'' at zs = 2) to optimize the likelihood of finding highly magnified high-z (z {\textgreater} 7) galaxies. A total of 16 broadband filters, spanning the near-UV to near-IR, are employed for each 20-orbit campaign on each cluster. These data are used to measure precise (σ z {\textasciitilde} 0.02(1 + z)) photometric redshifts for newly discovered arcs. Observations of each cluster are spread over eight epochs to enable a search for Type Ia supernovae at z {\textgreater} 1 to improve constraints on the time dependence of the dark energy equation of state and the evolution of supernovae. We present newly re-derived X-ray luminosities, temperatures, and Fe abundances for the CLASH clusters as well as a representative source list for MACS1149.6+2223 (z = 0.544).},

	abstract = {Photometric redshifts are quickly becoming an essential tool of observational cosmology, although their utilization is somewhat hindered by certain shortcomings of the existing methods, e.g., the unreliability of maximum-likelihood techniques or the limited application range of the ``training-set'' approach. The application of Bayesian inference to the problem of photometric redshift estimation effectively overcomes most of these problems. The use of prior probabilities and Bayesian marginalization facilitates the inclusion of relevant knowledge, such as the expected shape of the redshift distributions and the galaxy type fractions, which can be readily obtained from existing surveys but are often ignored by other methods. If this previous information is lacking or insufficient-for instance, because of the unprecedented depth of the observations-the corresponding prior distributions can be calibrated using even the data sample for which the photometric redshifts are being obtained. An important advantage of Bayesian statistics is that the accuracy of the redshift estimation can be characterized in a way that has no equivalents in other statistical approaches, enabling the selection of galaxy samples with extremely reliable photometric redshifts. In this way, it is possible to determine the properties of individual galaxies more accurately, and simultaneously estimate the statistical properties of a sample in an optimal fashion. Moreover, the Bayesian formalism described here can be easily generalized to deal with a wide range of problems that make use of photometric redshifts. There is excellent agreement between the {\textasciitilde}130 Hubble Deep Field North (HDF-N) spectroscopic redshifts and the predictions of the method, with a rms error of Δz{\textasciitilde}0.06(1+zspec) up to z{\textless}6 and no outliers nor systematic biases. It should be remarked that since these results have not been reached following a training-set procedure, the above value of Δz should be a fair estimate of the expected accuracy for any similar sample. The method is further tested by estimating redshifts in the HDF-N but restricting the color information to the UBVI filters; the results are shown to be significantly more reliable than those obtained with maximum-likelihood techniques.},

We implement a modern clumpy two-phase torus model, skirtor. To account for moderately extincted type 1 AGNs, we implement polar-dust extinction. We publicly release the source code (named ‘x-cigale’). We test x-cigale with X-ray detected AGNs in SDSS, COSMOS, and AKARI-NEP. The fitting quality (as indicated by reduced χ2) is good in general, indicating that x-cigale is capable of modelling the observed SED from X-ray to IR. We discuss constrainability and degeneracy of model parameters in the fitting of AKARI-NEP, for which excellent mid-IR photometric coverage is available. We also test fitting a sample of AKARI-NEP galaxies for which only X-ray upper limits are available from Chandra observations, and find that the upper limit can effectively constrain the AGN SED contribution for some systems.

Measuring how the physical properties of galaxies change across cosmic times is essential to understand galaxy formation and evolution. With the advent of numerous ground-based and space-borne instruments launched over the past few decades we now have exquisite multi-wavelength observations of galaxies from the far-ultraviolet (FUV) to the radio domain. To tap into this mine of data and obtain new insight into the formation and evolution of galaxies, it is essential that we are able to extract information from their spectral energy distribution (SED).{\textless}i{\textgreater}Aims{\textless}i/{\textgreater}. We present a completely new implementation of Code Investigating GALaxy Emission (CIGALE). Written in python, its main aims are to easily and efficiently model the FUV to radio spectrum of galaxies and estimate their physical properties such as star formation rate, attenuation, dust luminosity, stellar mass, and many other physical quantities.{\textless}i{\textgreater}Methods{\textless}i/{\textgreater}. To compute the spectral models, CIGALE builds composite stellar populations from simple stellar populations combined with highly flexible star formation histories, calculates the emission from gas ionised by massive stars, and attenuates both the stars and the ionised gas with a highly flexible attenuation curve. Based on an energy balance principle, the absorbed energy is then re-emitted by the dust in the mid- and far-infrared domains while thermal and non-thermal components are also included, extending the spectrum far into the radio range. A large grid of models is then fitted to the data and the physical properties are estimated through the analysis of the likelihood distribution.{\textless}i{\textgreater}Results{\textless}i/{\textgreater}. CIGALE is a versatile and easy-to-use tool that makes full use of the architecture of multi-core computers, building grids of millions of models and analysing samples of thousands of galaxies, both at high speed. Beyond fitting the SEDs of galaxies and parameter estimations, it can also be used as a model-generation tool or serve as a library to build new applications.},

	abstract = {When modeling and interpreting the spectral energy distributions (SEDs) of galaxies, the simple stellar population (SSP) model, star formation history (SFH), and dust attenuation law (DAL) are three of the most important components. However, each of them carries significant uncertainties that have seriously limited our ability to reliably recover the physical properties of galaxies from the analysis of their SEDs. In this paper, we present a Bayesian framework to deal with these uncertain components simultaneously. Based on the Bayesian evidence, a quantitative implement of the principle of Occam’s razor, the method allows a more objective and quantitative discrimination among the different assumptions about these uncertain components. With a Ks-selected sample of 5467 low-redshift (mostly with z ≲ 1) galaxies in the COSMOS/UltraVISTA field and classified into passively evolving galaxies (PEGs) and star-forming galaxies (SFGs) with the UVJ diagram, we present a Bayesian discrimination of a set of 16 SSP models from five research groups (BC03 and CB07, M05, GALEV, Yunnan-II, BPASS V2.0), five forms of SFH (Burst, Constant, Exp-dec, Exp-inc, Delayed-τ), and four kinds of DAL (Calzetti law, MW, LMC, SMC). We show that the results obtained with the method are either obvious or understandable in the context of stellar/galaxy physics. We conclude that the Bayesian model comparison method, especially that for a sample of galaxies, is very useful for discriminating the different assumptions in the SED modeling of galaxies. The new version of the BayeSED code, which is used in this work, is publicly available at https://bitbucket.org/hanyk/bayesed/.},

We extensively test our ability to recover realistic star formation histories (SFHs) by fitting mock observations of quiescent galaxies from the mufasa simulation. We then perform a detailed analysis of the SFHs of a sample of 9289 quiescent galaxies from UltraVISTA with stellar masses, M* \&gt; 1010 M⊙ and redshifts 0.25 \&lt; \$z\$ \&lt; 3.75. The majority of our sample exhibit SFHs that rise gradually then quench relatively rapidly over 1−2 Gyr. This behaviour is consistent with recent cosmological hydrodynamic simulations, where AGN-driven feedback in the low-accretion (jet) mode is the dominant quenching mechanism. At \$z\$ \&gt; 1, we also find a class of objects with SFHs that rise and fall very rapidly, with quenching time-scales of \&lt;1 Gyr, consistent with quasar-mode AGN feedback. Finally, at \$z\$ \&lt; 1 we find a population with SFHs which quench more slowly than they rise, over \&gt;3 Gyr, which we speculate to be the result of diminishing overall cosmic gas supply. We confirm the mass-accelerated evolution (downsizing) trend, and a trend towards more rapid quenching at higher stellar masses. However, our results suggest that the latter is a natural consequence of mass-accelerated evolution, rather than a change in quenching physics with stellar mass. We find 61 ± 8 per cent of \$z\$ \&gt; 1.5 massive-quenched galaxies undergo significant further evolution by \$z\$ = 0.5. bagpipes is available at bagpipes.readthedocs.io.},

	abstract = {Broadband photometry of galaxies measures an unresolved mix of complex stellar populations, gas, and dust. Interpreting these data is a challenge for models: many studies have shown that properties derived from modeling galaxy photometry are uncertain by a factor of two or more, and yet answering key questions in the field now requires higher accuracy than this. Here, we present a new model framework specifically designed for these complexities. Our model, Prospector-α, includes dust attenuation and re-radiation, a flexible attenuation curve, nebular emission, stellar metallicity, and a six-component nonparametric star formation history. The flexibility and range of the parameter space, coupled with Monte Carlo Markov chain sampling within the Prospector inference framework, is designed to provide unbiased parameters and realistic error bars. We assess the accuracy of the model with aperture-matched optical spectroscopy, which was excluded from the fits. We compare spectral features predicted solely from fits to the broadband photometry to the observed spectral features. Our model predicts Hα luminosities with a scatter of ∼0.18 dex and an offset of ∼0.1 dex across a wide range of morphological types and stellar masses. This agreement is remarkable, as the Hα luminosity is dependent on accurate star formation rates, dust attenuation, and stellar metallicities. The model also accurately predicts dust-sensitive Balmer decrements, spectroscopic stellar metallicities, polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbon mass fractions, and the age- and metallicity-sensitive features Dn4000 and Hδ. Although the model passes all these tests, we caution that we have not yet assessed its performance at higher redshift or the accuracy of recovered stellar masses.},

This flexible tool, named beagle (for BayEsian Analysis of GaLaxy sEds), allows one to build mock galaxy catalogues as well as to interpret any combination of photometric and spectroscopic galaxy observations in terms of physical parameters. The current version of the tool includes versatile modelling of the emission from stars and photoionized gas, attenuation by dust and accounting for different instrumental effects, such as spectroscopic flux calibration and line spread function. We show a first application of the beagle tool to the interpretation of broad-band SEDs of a published sample of \${\textbackslash}mathord \{{\textbackslash}sim \}10{\textasciicircum}4\$ galaxies at redshifts 0.1 ≲ z ≲ 8. We find that the constraints derived on photometric redshifts using this multipurpose tool are comparable to those obtained using public, dedicated photometric-redshift codes and quantify this result in a rigorous statistical way. We also show how the post-processing of beagle output data with the python extension pyp-beagle allows the characterization of systematic deviations between models and observations, in particular through posterior predictive checks. The modular design of the beagle tool allows easy extensions to incorporate, for example, the absorption by neutral galactic and circumgalactic gas, and the emission from an active galactic nucleus, dust and shock-ionized gas. Information about public releases of the beagle tool will be maintained on http://www.jacopochevallard.org/beagle.},

The new BayeSED code has been systematically tested on a mock sample of galaxies. The comparison between the estimated and input values of the parameters shows that BayeSED can recover the physical parameters of galaxies reasonably well. We then applied BayeSED to interpret the SEDs of a large Ks-selected sample of galaxies in the COSMOS/UltraVISTA field with stellar population synthesis models. Using the new BayeSED code, a Bayesian model comparison of stellar population synthesis models has been performed for the first time. We found that the 2003 model by Bruzual \& Charlot, statistically speaking, has greater Bayesian evidence than the 2005 model by Maraston for the Ks-selected sample. In addition, while setting the stellar metallicity as a free parameter obviously increases the Bayesian evidence of both models, varying the initial mass function has a notable effect only on the Maraston model. Meanwhile, the physical parameters estimated with BayeSED are found to be generally consistent with those obtained using the popular grid-based FAST code, while the former parameters exhibit more natural distributions. Based on the estimated physical parameters of the galaxies in the sample, we qualitatively classified the galaxies in the sample into five populations that may represent galaxies at different evolution stages or in different environments. We conclude that BayeSED could be a reliable and powerful tool for investigating the formation and evolution of galaxies from the rich multi-wavelength observations currently available.

	abstract = {We present BayeSED, a general purpose tool for Bayesian analysis of spectral energy distributions (SEDs) using pre-existing model SED libraries or their linear combinations. The artificial neural networks, principal component analysis, and multimodal-nested sampling (MultiNest) techniques are employed to allow the highly efficient sampling of posterior distribution and the calculation of Bayesian evidence. As a demonstration, we apply this tool to a sample of hyperluminous infrared galaxies (HLIRGs). The Bayesian evidence obtained for a pure starburst, a pure active galactic nucleus (AGN), and a linear combination of starburst+AGN models show that the starburst+AGN model has the highest evidence for all galaxies in this sample. The Bayesian evidence for the three models and the estimated contributions of starbursts and AGNs to infrared luminosity show that HLIRGs can be classified into two groups: one dominated by starbursts and the other dominated by AGNs. Other parameters and corresponding uncertainties about starbursts and AGNs are also estimated using the model with the highest Bayesian evidence. We find that the starburst region of the HLIRGs dominated by starbursts tends to be more compact and has a higher fraction of OB stars than that of HLIRGs dominated by AGNs. Meanwhile, the AGN torus of the HLIRGs dominated by AGNs tends to be more dusty than that of HLIRGs dominated by starbursts. These results are consistent with previous researches, but need to be tested further with larger samples. Overall, we believe that BayeSED could be a reliable and efficient tool for exploring the nature of complex systems such as dust-obscured starburst–AGN composite systems by decoding their SEDs.},

Depending on the input redshifts, filter fluxes were computed for the model set and compared to the galaxy photometry by carrying out a Bayesian-like analysis. CIGALE was tested by analysing 39 nearby galaxies selected from SINGS. The reliability of the different model parameters was evaluated by studying the resulting expectation values and their standard deviations in relation to the input model grid. Moreover, the influence of the filter set and the quality of photometric data on the code results was estimated.{\textless}i{\textgreater}Results. {\textless}i/{\textgreater}For up to 17 filters with effective wavelengths between 0.15 and 160 {\textless}i{\textgreater}μ{\textless}i/{\textgreater}m, we find robust results for the mass, star formation rate, effective age of the stellar population at 4000 Å, bolometric luminosity, luminosity absorbed by dust, and attenuation in the far-UV.

	abstract = {We present a simple, largely empirical but physically motivated model to interpret the mid- and far-infrared spectral energy distributions of galaxies consistently with the emission at ultraviolet, optical and near-infrared wavelengths. Our model relies on an existing angle-averaged prescription to compute the absorption of starlight by dust in stellar birth clouds and in the ambient interstellar medium (ISM) in galaxies. We compute the spectral energy distribution of the power reradiated by dust in stellar birth clouds as the sum of three components: a component of polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAHs); a mid-infrared continuum characterizing the emission from hot grains at temperatures in the range 130–250 K; and a component of grains in thermal equilibrium with adjustable temperature in the range 30–60 K. In the ambient ISM, we fix for simplicity the relative proportions of these three components to reproduce the spectral shape of diffuse cirrus emission in the Milky Way, and we include a component of cold grains in thermal equilibrium with adjustable temperature in the range 15–25 K. Our model is both simple and versatile enough that it can be used to derive statistical constraints on the star formation histories and dust contents of large samples of galaxies using a wide range of ultraviolet, optical and infrared observations. We illustrate this by deriving median likelihood estimates of the star formation rates, stellar masses, effective dust optical depths, dust masses and relative strengths of different dust components of 66 well-studied nearby star-forming galaxies from the Spitzer Infrared Nearby Galaxy Survey (SINGS). We explore how the constraints derived in this way depend on the available spectral information. From our analysis of the SINGS sample, we conclude that the mid- and far-infrared colours of galaxies correlate strongly with the specific star formation rate, as well as with other galaxy-wide quantities connected to this parameter, such as the ratio of infrared luminosity between stellar birth clouds and the ambient ISM, the contributions by PAHs and grains in thermal equilibrium to the total infrared emission, and the ratio of dust mass to stellar mass. Our model can be straightforwardly applied to interpret ultraviolet, optical and infrared spectral energy distributions from any galaxy sample.},
